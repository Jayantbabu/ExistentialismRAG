Thus Spoke Zarathustra Among the Daughters of the Desert 1 Do not go! (said then the wanderer who called himself Zarathustra’s shadow) stay with us, otherwise the old, dull affliction may again assail us.  That old sorcerer has already done his worst for our benefit, and just look, the good, pious pope there has tears in his eyes and has again embarked on the sea of melancholy.  These kings there may still put on a brave face before us: for they have learned that better than any of us today! But had they no witnesses, I wager that with them, too, the bitter business would begin again – the bitter business of drifting clouds, of damp melancholy, of veiled skies, of stolen suns, of howling autumn winds, the bitter business of our howling and cries of distress: stay with us, O Zarathustra! Here there is much hidden misery that wants to speak out, much evening, much cloud, much damp air! You have fed us with strong man’s fare and nourishing sayings: do not let us, for dessert, be assailed again by delicate, effeminate spirits! You alone make the air around you robust and clear I Have I ever found on earth such good air as with you in your cave? I have seen many lands, my nose has learned to test and appraise many kinds of air: but with you my nostrils taste their greatest delight! Except, except – oh forgive an old memory! Forgive me an old after-dinner song that I once composed among the daughters of the desert - for with them there was the same good, clear, oriental air; there I was farthest away from cloudy, damp, melancholy Old Europe! In those days I loved such oriental girls and other blue kingdoms of heaven, over which no clouds and no thoughts hung.  You would not believe how prettily they sat there when they were not dancing, deep but without thoughts, like little secrets, like ribboned riddles, like after-dinner nuts - motley and strange indeed! but without clouds: riddles that one can read: to please such girls I then devised an after-dinner psalm.  Thus spoke the wanderer and shadow; and before anyone could answer him he had seized the old sorcerer’s harp, crossed his legs, and looked calmly and sagely about him -with his nostrils, however, he drew in the air slowly and inquiringly, like someone tasting strange air in strange lands.  Thereupon he began to sing with a kind of roaring.  2 Deserts grew: woe to him who harbours deserts ! Ha! Solemnly! Solemnly indeed! A worthy beginning! Solemnly in an African way! Worthy of a lion Or of a moral screech-ape – but it is nothing for you, You desert maidens, At whose feet I, For the first time, A European under palm-trees, Am permitted to sit.  Selah.  Wonderful, truly! Here I now sit, Beside the desert, and Yet so far from the desert, And in no way devastated: For I am swallowed down By this smallest oasis: – it simply opened, yawning, Its sweetest mouth, The sweetest-smelling of all little mouths: Then I fell in, Down, straight through – among you, You dearest maidens! Selah.  All hail to that whale If it made things so pleasant For its guests! – you understand My learned allusion? All hail to his belly If it was As sweet an oasis-belly As this is: which, however, I call in question, – since I come from Europe, Which is more sceptical than Any little old wife.  May God improve it! Amen! Here I now sit In this smallest oasis Like a date, Brown, sweet, oozing golden, Longing for a girl’s rounded mouth, But longing more for girlish, Ice-cold, snow-white, cutting Teeth: for these do The hearts of all hot dates lust.  Selah.  Like, all too like That aforesaid southern fruit Do I lie here, by little Flying insects Sniffed and played around, And by even smaller, More foolish and more sinful Wishes and notions, Besieged by you, You silent girl-kittens Full of misgivings, Dudu and Suleika, Sphinxed round , that I may cram Much feeling into two words: (May God forgive me This sin of speech!) I sit here sniffing the finest air, Air of Paradise, truly, Bright, buoyant air, gold-streaked, As good air as ever Fell from the moon - Came it by chance, Or did it happen by wantonness, As the old poets tell? I, doubter, however, call it In question; since I come From Europe, Which is more sceptical than any Little old wife.  May God improve it I Amen.  Drinking in the fairest air, With nostrils swollen like goblets, Without future, without memories, Thus do I sit here, you Dearest maidens, And regard the palm-tree, And watch how, like a dancer, It bends and bows and sways at the hips, – if one watches long one follows suit! Like a dancer who, it would seem, Has stood long, dangerously long, Always on one little leg? – so that she has forgotten, it would seem, Her other leg? At least, in vain I sought the missing Twin-jewel – that is, the other leg – In the sacred vicinity Of her dearest, daintiest Little fluttering, flickering, fan-swirling skirt.  Yes, if you would quite believe me, You sweet maidens: She has lost it! It has gone! Gone for ever! That other leg! Oh, what a shame about that other dear leg! Where can it now be, sorrowing forsaken? That lonely leg? Perhaps in fear before an Angry, blonde-maned Lion-monster? Or perhaps even Gnawed off, broken in pieces - Pitiable, alas! alas! broken in pieces! Selah.  Oh do not weep, Gentle hearts! Do not weep, you Date-hearts! Milk-bosoms! You heart-caskets Of sweetwood! Do not weep, Pale Dudu! Be a man, Suleika! Courage! Courage! – Or would perhaps Something bracing, heart-bracing, Be in place here? An anointed proverb? A solemn exhortation? Ha! Up, dignity! Virtuous dignity! European dignity! Blow, blow again, Bellows of virtue! Ha! Roar once again, Roar morally! Roar like a moral lion Before the daughters of the desert! For virtuous howling, You dearest maidens, Is loved best of all by European ardour, European appetite! And here I stand now, As European, I cannot do otherwise, so help me God! 52 Amen! Deserts grow: woe to him who harbours deserts! Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Poets ‘S INCE I have known the body better,’ said Zarathustra to one of his disciples, ‘the spirit has been only figuratively spirit to me; and all that is “intransitory” – that too has been only an “image”’.  19 ‘I heard you say that once before,’ answered the disciple; ‘and then you added: “But the poets lie too much.” Why did you say that the poets lie too much?’ ‘Why?’ said Zarathustra.  ‘You ask why? I am not one of those who may be questioned about their Why.  ‘Do my experiences date from yesterday? It is a long time since I experienced the reasons for my opinions.  ‘Should I not have to be a barrel of memory, if I wanted to carry my reasons, too, about with me? ‘It is already too much for me to retain even my opinions; and many a bird has flown away.  ‘And now and then I find in my dove-cote an immigrant creature which is strange to me and which trembles when I lay my hand upon it.  ‘Yet what did Zarathustra once say to you? That the poets lie too much? – But Zarathustra too is a poet.  ‘Do you now believe that he spoke the truth? Why do you believe it?’ The disciple answered: ‘I believe in Zarathustra.’ But Zarathustra shook his head and smiled.  Belief does not make me blessed (he said), least of all belief in myself.  But granted that someone has said in all seriousness that the poets lie too much: he is right – we do lie too much.  We know too little and are bad learners: so we have to lie.  And which of us poets has not adulterated his wine? Many a poisonous hotch-potch has been produced in our cellars, many an indescribable thing has been done there.  And because we know little, the poor in spirit delight our hearts, especially when they are young women.  And we desire even those things the old women tell one another in the evening.  We call that the eternal-womanly in us.  And we believe in the people and its ‘wisdom’ as if there were a special secret entrance to knowledge which is blocked to him who has learned anything.  But all poets believe this: that he who, lying in the grass or in lonely bowers, pricks up his ears, catches a little of the things that are between heaven and earth.  And if they experience tender emotions, the poets always think that nature herself is in love with them: And that she creeps up to their ears, to speak secrets and amorous flattering words into them: of this they boast and pride themselves before all mortals! Alas, there are so many things between heaven and earth of which only the poets have let themselves dream! And especially above heaven: for all gods are poets’ images, poets’ surreptitiousness! Truly, it draws us ever upward – that is, to cloudland: we set our motley puppets on the clouds and then call them gods and supermen.  And are they not light enough for these insubstantial seats? – all these gods and supermen.  Alas, how weary I am of all the unattainable that is supposed to be reality.  Alas, how weary I am of the poets! When Zarathustra had spoken thus, his disciple was angry with him, but kept silent.  And Zarathustra, too, kept silent; and his eye had turned within him as if it were gazing into the far distance.  At length he sighed and drew a breath.  I am of today and of the has-been (he said then); but there is something in me that is of tomorrow and of the day-after-tomorrow and of the shall-be.  I have grown weary of the poets, the old and the new: they all seem to me superficial and shallow seas.  They have not thought deeply enough: therefore their feeling – has not plumbed the depths.  A little voluptuousness and a little tedium: that is all their best ideas have ever amounted to.  All their harp-jangling is to me so much coughing and puffing of phantoms; what have they ever known of the ardour of tones! They are not clean enough for me, either: they all disturb their waters so that they may seem deep.  And in that way they would like to show themselves reconcilers: but to me they remain mediators and meddlers, and mediocre and unclean men! Ah, indeed I cast my net into their sea and hoped to catch fine fish; but I always drew out an old god’s head.  Thus the sea gave a stone to the hungry man.  And they themselves may well originate from the sea.  To be sure, one finds pearls in them: then they themselves are all the more like hard shell-fish.  And instead of the soul I often found in them salty slime.  They learned vanity, too, from the sea: is the sea not the peacock of peacocks? It unfurls its tail even before the ugliest of buffaloes, it never wearies of its lace-fan of silver and satin.  The buffalo looks on insolently, his soul like the sand, yet more like the thicket, but most like the swamp.  What are beauty and sea and peacock-ornaments to him? I speak this parable to the poets.  Truly, their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks and a sea of vanity! The poet’s spirit wants spectators, even if they are only buffaloes! But I have grown weary of this spirit: and I see the day coming when it will grow weary of itself.  Already I have seen the poets transformed; I have seen them direct their glance upon themselves.  I have seen penitents of the spirit appearing: they grew out of the poets.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Chairs of Virtue Z ARATHUSTRA heard a wise man praised who was said to discourse well on sleep and virtue: he was greatly honoured and rewarded for it, and all the young men sat before his chair.  Zarathustra went to him and sat before his chair with all the young men.  And thus spoke the wise man: Honour to sleep and modesty before it! That is the first thing! And avoid all those who sleep badly and are awake at night! Even the thief is shamed when confronted with sleep: he always steals softly through the night.  But shameless is the night-watchman, shamelessly he bears his horn.  Sleeping is no mean art: you need to stay awake all day to doit.  You must overcome yourself ten times a day: that causes a fine weariness and is opium to the soul.  Ten times must you be reconciled to yourself again: for overcoming is bitterness and the unreconciled man sleeps badly.  You must discover ten truths a day: otherwise you will seek truth in the night too, with your soul still hungry.  You must laugh and be cheerful ten times a day: or your stomach, that father of affliction, will disturb you in the night.  Few know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep well.  Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery? Shall I covet my neighbour’s maidservant? None of this would be consistent with good sleep.  And even when one has all the virtues, there is still one thing to remember: to send even these virtues to sleep at the proper time.  That they may not quarrel among themselves, the pretty little women! And over you, unhappy man! Peace with God and with your neighbour: thus good sleep will have it.  And peace too with your neighbour’s devil.  Otherwise he will haunt you at night.  Honour and obedience to the authorities, and even to the crooked authorities! Thus good sleep will have it.  How can I help it that power likes to walk on crooked legs? I shall always call him the best herdsman who leads his sheep to the greenest meadows: that accords with good sleep.  I do not desire much honour, nor great treasure: they excite spleen.  But one sleeps badly without a good name and a small treasure.  The company of a few is more welcome to me than bad company: but they must come and go at the proper time.  That accords with good sleep.  The poor in spirit, too, please me greatly: they further sleep.  Blessed and happy they are indeed, especially if one always agrees with their views.  Thus for the virtuous man does the day pass.  And when night comes I take good care not to summon sleep! He, the lord of virtues, does not like to be summoned! But I remember what I have done and thought during the day.  Ruminating I ask myself, patient as a cow: What were your ten overcomings? And which were the ten reconciliations and the ten truths and the ten fits of laughter with which my heart enjoyed itself? As I ponder such things rocked by my forty thoughts, sleep, the lord of virtue, suddenly overtakes me uncalled.  Sleep knocks on my eyes: they grow heavy.  Sleep touches my mouth: it stays open.  Truly, he comes to me on soft soles, the dearest of thieves, and steals my thoughts from me: I stand as silent as this chair.  But I do not stand for long: already I am lying down.  When Zarathustra heard the wise man’s words he laughed in his heart: for through them a light had dawned upon him.  And he spoke thus to his heart: This wise man with his forty thoughts seems to me a fool: but I believe he knows well enough how to sleep.  Happy is he who lives in this wise man’s neighbourhood.  Such sleep is contagious, even through a thick wall.  A spell dwells even in his chair.  And the young men have not sat in vain before the preacher of virtue.  His wisdom is: stay awake in order to sleep well.  And truly, if life had no sense and I had to choose nonsense, this would be the most desirable nonsense for me, too.  Now it is clear to me what people were once seeking above all when they sought the teachers of virtue.  They sought good sleep and opium virtues to bring it about! To all of these lauded wise men of the academic chairs, wisdom meant sleep without dreams: they knew no better meaning of life.  And today too there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is up.  And they shall not stand for much longer: already they are lying down.  Blessed are these drowsy men: for they shall soon drop off.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra 1 T HE first thing a reader of Thus Spoke Zarathustra will notice, even before he/she notices what is being said, is the manner of saying it: or rather, the excess of manner.  The book’s worst fault is excess.  That this is the most forgivable of faults doesn’t change the fact that it is a fault.  As it happens, excess is the one fault no one could impute to Nietzsche’s subsequent works: there concision, brevity, directness of statement are present to a degree not even approximated by any other German philosopher (and hardly equalled by any writer of any kind).  It is clear that the rhetorical-oratorical is something Nietzsche was impelled to, gave way to and thus got rid of in Zarathustra : the eruption of words, metaphors, figures and word-play suggests an eruption of feeling.  It will be our job here to try to discover why this eruption became necessary, and why just at this time (i.e.  January I883), and thus to understand better what this great odd book is really about.  2 Thus Spoke Zarathustra is (to anticipate out conclusion somewhat) the resolution of a long-sustained intellectual crisis.  Let the word ‘intellectual’ not mislead: unlike most people, even most philosophers, Nietzsche lived with his intellectual problems as with realities, he experienced a similar emotional commitment to them as other men experience to their wife and children.  It is this, indeed, which is the badge of his uniqueness and the key to understanding him.  He makes clear what he means by intellectual problems in these few posthumously-published notes: As soon as you feel yourself against me you have ceased to understand my position and consequently my arguments! You have to be the victim of the same passion ! I want to awaken the greatest mistrust of myself: I speak only of things I have experienced and do not offer only events in the head.  One must want to experience the great problems with one’s body and one’s soul.  I have at all times written my writings with my whole heart and soul: I do not know what purely intellectual problems are.  You know these things as thoughts, but your thoughts are not your experiences, they are an echo and after-effect of your experiences: as when your room trembles when a carriage goes past.  I however am sitting in the carriage, and often I am the carriage itself.  In a man who thinks like this, the dichotomy between thinking and feeling, intellect and passion, has really disappeared.  He feels his thoughts.  He can fall in love with an idea.  An idea can make him ill.  His forbears were Lutherans.  Many were in the Lutheran church: his father and both grandfathers were Lutheran ministers, and his paternal grandfather was a Superintendent, the Lutheran equivalent of a bishop.  As a boy he was, as befitted a pastor’s son, intensely pious, but he lost his faith during his late teens and abandoned the study of theology.  He replaced religious belief with freelance philosophizing, upon which he brought to bear the intensity of involvement he had withdrawn from religion.  The path away from the family parsonage was the path of scepticism.  Schopenhaueran metaphysics and Wagnerian music were detours, ersatz religion.  In the summer of 1876, in his thirty-second year, he returned to the sceptical path and started on the series of aphoristic books which constitute probably the most thorough course in scepticism produced in the nineteenth century.  Human, All Too Human appeared in 1878, Assorted Opinions and Maxims in 1879, The Wanderer and his Shadow in 1880; in June 1881 he published Dawn , These books embody reflexions on a very wide range of subjects, but the controlling tendency of his thought during all these five years is nonetheless unmistakable: it is to break down all the concepts and qualities in which mankind takes pride and pleasure into a few simple qualities in which no one takes pride of pleasure and to see in the latter the origin of the former; likewise to undermine morality by exposing its non-moral basis and rationality by exposing its irrational basis; likewise to abolish the ‘higher’ world, the metaphysical, by accounting for all its supposed manifestations in terms of the human, phenomenal, and even animal world; in brief, the controlling tendency of his thought is nihilist .  The cheerful tone, the stylistic beauty, the coolness of the performance cannot conceal that what is taking place is destruction.  The fact was, in any event, obvious to Nietzsche himself; and of all his problems this became the greatest, the most pressing, the one with which his ‘passion’ was most engaged.  He had come close to a total devaluation of humanity and because he could as yet see no way of halting this movement he took the only course open to him: he pushed it on to its limit.  The earlier parts of his next book, The Gay Science , were intended for Dawn ; they were excluded partly because he thought that book had grown sufficiently bulky, but also, I would say, because of the enhanced vehemence of what he was now thinking and writing.  The nihilism of his position is now stated frankly: The four errors , Man has been reared by his errors: first he never saw himself other than imperfectly, second he attributed to himself imaginary qualities, third he felt himself in a false order of rank with animal and nature, fourth he continually invented new tables of values and for a time took each of them to be eternal and unconditional, so that now this, now that human drive and state took first place and was, as a consequence of this evaluation, ennobled.  If one deducts the effect of these four errors, one has also deducted away humanity, humaneness and ‘human dignity’.  (115).  He looks more squarely in the face and discusses more urgently the question whether ‘truth’ is in any way discoverable or whether mankind is not necessitated to error: Life no argument .  We have arranged for ourselves a world in which we are able to live – with the postulation of bodies, lines, surfaces, causes and effects, motion and rest, form and content: without these articles of faith nobody could now endure to live! But that does not yet mean they ate something proved and demonstrated.  Life is no argument; among the conditions of life could be error.  (121).  He reaches what seems to be the final term in this line of argument: Ultimate scepticism .  What then in the last resort are the truths of mankind? – They are the irrefutable errors of mankind.  (265).  His conception of the world as meaningless and chaotic is rounded off.  That God is dead is announced in a famous passage: The madman .  Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market place and cried incessantly: ‘I am looking for God! I am looking for God!’ -As many of those who did not believe in God were standing together there he excited considerable laughter.  Have you lost him then? said one.  Did he lose his way like a child? said another.  Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? or emigrated? – thus they shouted and laughed.  The madman sprang into their midst and pierced them with his glances.  ‘Where has God gone?’ he cried.  ‘I shall tell you.  We have killed him — you and I.  We are all his murderers.  But how have we done this? How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving now? Away from all suns? Are we not perpetually falling? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is more and more night not coming on all the time? Must not lanterns be lit in the morning? Do we not hear anything yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we not smell anything yet of God’s decomposition? – gods too decompose.  God is dead.  God remains dead.  And we have killed him.  How shall we, the murderers of all murderers, console ourselves? That which was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet possessed has bled to death under our knives – who will wipe this blood off us? With what water could we purify ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we need to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must not we ourselves become gods simply to seem worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed – and whoever shall be born after us, for the sake of this deed he shall be part of a higher history than all history hitherto.’…(125).  Not only is there no God, there is no other ordering principle either: Let us beware ! Let us beware of thinking the world is a living being.  Whither should it spread itself? What should it nourish itself with? How could it grow and multiply? We know indeed more or less what the organic is: and shall we reinterpret the unspeakably derivative, late, rare, chance phenomena which we perceive only on the surface of the earth into the essential, universal, eternal, as they do who call the universe an organism? I find that disgusting.  Let us likewise beware of believing the universe is a machine; it is certainly not constructed so as to perform some operation, we do it far too great honour with the word ‘machine’.  Let us beware of presupposing that something so orderly as the cyclical motions of our planetary neighbours are the general and universal case; even a glance at the Milky Way gives rise to doubt whether there may not there exist far more crude and contradictory motions, likewise stars with eternally straight trajectories, and the like.  The astral order in which we live is an exception; this order and the apparent permanence which is conditional upon it is in its turn made possible by the exception of exceptions: the formation of the organic.  The total nature of the world is, on the other hand, to all eternity chaos, not in the sense that necessity is lacking but in that order, structure, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever other human aesthetic notions we may have are lacking.  Judged from the viewpoint of our reason, the unsuccessful cases are far and away the rule, the exceptions are not the secret objective, and the whole contraption repeats its theme, which can never be called a melody, over and over again to eternity – and ultimately even the term ‘unsuccessful case’ is already a humanization which contains a reproof.  But how can we venture to reprove or praise the universe! Let us beware of attributing to it heartlessness and unreason or their opposites: it is neither perfect nor beautiful nor noble, and has no desire to become any of these; it is by no means striving to imitate mankind! It is quite impervious to all our aesthetic and moral judgements! It has likewise no impulse to self-preservation or impulses of any kind; neither does it know any laws.  Let us beware of saying there are laws in nature.  There are only necessities: there is no one to command, no one to obey, no one to transgress….  Let us beware of saying that death is the opposite of life.  The living being is only a species of the dead, and a very rare species….  (109).  These passages and very many more like them are included in the first three of the four books which constitute the original edition of The Gay Science : they seem to me to mark the end of the road on which Nietzsche set out when he left his forefathers’ faith and went off alone.  I do not see how he or anyone could go further in this direction.  If he had not found some other direction he would at this time – the second half of 1881 – have reached his end station: and it is his knowledge that this is so that constitutes the intellectual crisis of which Zarathtutra is the resolution.  3 We must now take a look at another aspect of Nietzsche’s authorship.  So far as modern Europe is concerned he was very much a pioneer in the demolition of ancient habits of mind and moral prejudices, and he was moreover very little read during his active life: so that to a great degree he had to be his own commentator and critic.  There is an element in his work which derives directly from this fact.  You will often hear not one voice but two: one asserts, the other objects and qualifies.  Or one draws a sombre, the other a happy conclusion from the same premisses.  Now one important duty of the second voice is to intimate, at strategic points in the books, that all the demolition going on may be only the essential preliminary and prerequisite for new construction; and none of these passages is more eloquent or revealing than that which stands at the end of Dawn : We aeronauts of the spirit ! All those brave birds which fly out into the distance, into the farthest distance – it is certain! somewhere or other they will be unable to go on and will perch down on a mast or a bare cliff-face – and they will even be thankful for this miserable accommodation! But who could venture to infer from that, that there was not an immense open space before them, that they had flown as far as one could fly! All our great teachers and predecessors have at last come to a stop…; it will be the same with you and me! But what does that matter to you and me! Other birds will fly farther ! This insight and faith of ours vies with them in flying up and away; it rises above our heads and above our impotence into the heights and from there surveys the distance and sees before it the flocks of birds which, far stronger than we, still strive whither we have striven, and where everything is sea, sea, sea! – And whither then would we go? Would we cross the sea? Whither does this mighty longing draw us, this longing that is worth more to us than any pleasure? Why just in this direction, thither where all the suns of humanity have hitherto gone down? Will it perhaps be said of us one day that we too, steering westward, hoped to reach an India – but that it was our fate to be wrecked against infinity? Or, my brothers? Or? – (575).  This makes a brave sound, and the feeling that it expresses – that there are new worlds to be opened up – came to dominate more and more from the summer of 1881 onwards.  ‘Ideas have arisen on my horizon the like of which I have never seen before…’, Nietzsche wrote to Peter Gast on 14 August 1881.  ‘I shall certainly have to live a few years more!…The intensity of my feelings makes me shudder and laugh – a couple of times I couldn’t leave my room for the ludicrous reason that my eyes were inflamed….  Each time I had been weeping too much on my walks the day before, not sentimental tears but tears of rejoicing; and as I wept I sang and talked nonsense, filled with a new vision…’ This is not an altogether new note, but the intensity is new and the ‘ideas’ alluded to are also new and new in this sense that they are direct attempts to go beyond the nihilist conclusions of the past five years without being obliged to retract any of them.  The fourth book of The Gay Science is a signpost pointing the way Nietzsche is going.  Always under the influence of significant dates, he opens it with a passage written on New Year’s Day 1882: For the New Year .  I am still living, I am still thinking: I have to go on living because I have to go on thinking.  Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum .  Today everyone is permitted to express his desire and dearest thoughts: so I too would like to say what I have desired of myself today and what thought was the first to cross my heart this year – what thought shall be the basis, guarantee and sweetness of all my future life! I want to learn more and more to see what is necessary in things as the beautiful in them – thus I shall become one of those who make things beautiful.  Amor fati: may that be my love from now on! I want to wage no war against the ugly.  I do not want to accuse, I do not want even to accuse the accusers.  May looking away be my only form of negation! And, all in all: I want to be at all times hereafter only an affirmer (ein Ja -sagender) ! (276).  This challenge to everything nihilist in his nature is followed a little later by a call to action, battle and positive commitment phrased in one of his most famous coinages – perhaps actually the most famous phrase in all his works: I greet all the signs that a more manly, warlike age is coming, which will, above all, bring valour again into honour! For it has to prepare the way for a yet higher age, and assemble the force which that age will one day have need of – that age which will carry heroism into knowledge and wage war for the sake of ideas and their consequences.  To that end many brave pioneers are needed now…: men who know how to be silent, solitary, resolute,…who have an innate disposition to seek in all things that which must be overcome in them: men to whom cheerfulness, patience, simplicity and contempt for the great vanities belong just as much as do generosity in victory and indulgence towards the little vanities of the defeated:…men with their own festivals, their own work-days, their own days of mourning, accustomed to and assured in command and equally ready to obey when necessary, equally proud in the one case as in the other, equally serving their own cause: men more imperilled, men more fruitful, happier men! For believe me! – the secret of realizing the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment of existence is: to live dangerously ! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships out into uncharted seas! Live in conflict with your equals and with yourselves! Be robbers and ravagers as long as you cannot be rulers and owners, you men of knowledge!…(283).  A new image of man, of what mankind might be, begins to appear: Excelsior ! ‘You will never again pray, never again worship, never again repose in limitless trust – you deny it to yourself to remain halted before an ultimate wisdom, ultimate good, ultimate power, and there unharness your thoughts – you have no perpetual guardian and friend for your seven solitudes…there is no longer for you any rewarder and recompenser, no final corrector – there is no longer any reason in what happens, no longer any love in what happens to you – there is no longer any resting-place open to your heart where it has only to find and no longer to seek, you resist any kind of ultimate peace, you want the eternal recurrence of war and peace – man of renuncktion, will you renounce in all this? Who will give you the strength for it? No one has yet possessed this strength!’ – There is a lake which one day denied it to itself to flow away and threw up a dam at the place where it formerly flowed away: since then this lake has risen higher and higher.  Perhaps it is precisely that renunciation which will also lend us the strength by which the renunciation itself can be endured; perhaps man will rise higher and higher from that time when he no longer flaws out into a god.  (285).  And the penultimate section of the book is a very curious suggestion for a formula of self- and life-affirmation: The heaviest burden .  What if a demon crept after you one day or night in your loneliest solitude and said to you: ‘This life, as you live it now and have lived it, you will have to live again and again, times without number; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and all the unspeakably small and great in your life must return to you, and everything in the same series and sequence – and in the same way this spider and this moonlight among the trees, and in the same way this moment and I myself.  The eternal hour-glass of existence will be turned again and again – and you with it, you dust of dust!’ – Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who thus spoke? Or have you experienced a tremendous moment in which you would have answered him: ‘You are a god and never did I hear anything more divine!’ If this thought gained power over you it would, as you are now, transform and perhaps crush you; the question in all and everything: ‘do you want this again and again, times without number?’ would lie as the heaviest burden upon all your actions.  Or how well disposed towards yourself and towards life would you have to become to have no greater desire than for this ultimate eternal sanction and sea!? (341).  In April 1882 began the one wholly serious sexual involvement of Nietzsche’s life: his brief and humiliating affair with Lou Salomé.  This is not the place to go into the details of that affair; I discuss it here at all only because it has some bearing on the ‘man in solitude’ aspect of Zarathustra and because it is part of the general state of crisis in which Nietzsche existed during the eighteen months from the summer of 1881 to the beginning of 1883.  Only two points need to be made.  Firstly, Nietzsche thought that the solitude in which he had been living since his enforced retirement from Basel University at Easter 1879 and which had been weighing more and more heavily upon him was about to come to an end.  In a letter to Lou Salomé (2 July 1882) he says that the previous day ‘it seemed as if it must be my birthday: you sent me your assent i.e.  to come and stay with him for three weeks, the best present anyone could have given me…Teubner a printer sent the first three proof-sheets of the Gey Science , and in addition to all this the last part of the manuscript of the Gay Science was completed, and therewith the work of six years (1876 to 1882), my entire “free-thought”!’ This means that when he wrote this letter he had just made a fair copy of the following passage, which closes The Gay Science in its original version: Incipit tragoedia .  When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and Lake Urmi and went into the mountains.  Here he had the enjoyment of his spirit and his solitude and he did not weary of it for ten years.  But at last his heart turned – and one morning he rose with the dawn, stepped before the sun, and spoke to it thus: ‘Great star! What would your happiness be, if you had not those for whom you shine! You have come up here to my cave for ten years: you would have grown weary of your light and of this journey, without me, my eagle and my serpent; but we waited for you every morning, took from you your superfluity and blessed you for it.  Behold! I am weary of my wisdom, like a bee that has gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it; I should like to give it away and distribute it, until the wise among men have again become happy in their folly and the poor happy in their wealth.  To that end, I must descend into the depths: as you do at evening, when you go behind the sea and bring light to the underworld too, superabundant star! – like you, I must go down — as men, to whom I want to descend, call it.  So bless me then, tranquil eye, that can behold without envy even an excessive happiness! Bless the cup that wants to overflow, that the waters may flow golden from him and bear the reflexion of your joy over all the world! Behold! This cup wants to be empty again, and Zarathustra wants to be man again.’ – Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.  (342).  The sense of this passage is repeated in other words at the end of the above-quoted letter: ‘I don’t want to be lonely any more; I want to learn to be human again.  Alas, in this field I have almost everything still to learn!’ Undoubtedly Nietzsche at this point identified himself with another ‘teacher’ who came down out of solitude around his fortieth year.  The second point is that, after he was abandoned during the following October by Lou Salomé and had to realize that his hope of marrying her was definitely not going to be fulfilled, he fell into an abyss of despair.  I am not underrating the emotional effect which such a disappointment might normally be expected to produce, but its effect on Nietzsche was certainly very violent indeed, especially considering that his disposition was usually a cheerful one.  It should be recalled that he had been recurrently ill since 1871 – almost certainly a consequence of a syphilitic infection contracted when a student – and the inability of these attacks to depress him or do more than delay his work is a witness to the resilience of his temperament.  His failure with Lou, however, threw him for a time completely off balance – how far off balance can be gauged, for example, from this letter to Franz Overbeck, posted on Christmas Day 1882: I have suffered from the disgraceful and anguishing recollections of this past summer as from a kind of madness….  They involve a conflict of contrary emotions which I am not equal to.…If only I could sleep! But the strongest sleeping-draughts help as little as do the six to eight hour walks I take.  If I cannot find the magic formula to turn all this – muck to gold , I am lost….  I now mistrust everybody: I sense in everything I hear contempt towards me.…Sometimes I think of renting a small room in Basel, visiting you now and then and attending lectures.  Sometimes I think of doing the opposite: of driving my solitude and resignation to the ultimate limit and – The ground of this violent reaction was, as other letters but especially Zarathustra show, the realization he was back in solitude and that he was going to stay there.  With the benefit of hindsight we can see that by the turn of the year 1882–83 there had been assembled in Nietzsche the material for an explosion of some sort – or rather, as we shall discover, an eruption .  Intellectually, emotionally and physically he was all but exhausted; but the ‘ideas’ of the summer of 1881 as they had received tentative expression in the fourth book of The Gay Science are preliminary rumblings which indicate what is coming.  In January – ‘as a result of ten absolutely fresh and cheerful January days’ – the tension broke, inhibition gave way, and the first part of Zarathustra came furiously out.  ‘Has anyone at the end of the nineteenth century a distinct conception of what poets of strong ages called inspiration?’ he asked in Ecce Homo, apropos of Zarathustra .  If not, I will describe it.  – If one had the slightest residue of superstition left in one, one would hardly be able to set aside the idea that one is merely incarnation, merely mouthpiece, merely medium of overwhelming forces.  The concept of revelation, in the sense that something suddenly, with unspeakable certainty and subtlety, becomes viable , audible, something that shakes and overturns one to the depths, simply describes the fact.  One hears, one does not seek; one takes, one does not ask who gives; a thought flashes up like lightning, with necessity, unfalteringly formed – I have never had any choice.  An ecstasy whose tremendous tension sometimes discharges itself in a flood of tears, while one’s steps now involuntarily rush along, now involuntarily lag;…a depth of happiness in which the most painful and gloomy things appear, not as an antithesis, but as conditioned, demanded, as a necessary colour within such a superfluity of light;…Everything is in the highest degree involuntary but takes place as in a tempest of a feeling of freedom, of absoluteness, of power, of divinity.  The involuntary nature of image, of metaphor is the most remarkable thing of all; one no longer has any idea what is image, what metaphor, everything presents itself as the readiest, the truest, the simplest means of expression.  It really does seem, to allude to an expression of Zarathustra’s, as if the things themselves approached and offered themselves as metaphors…This is my experience of inspiration; I do not doubt that one has to go back thousands of years to find anyone who could say to me ‘it is mine also’.  Zarathustra again emerges from his ten-year solitude, but now the mankind to whom he wants to address himself rejects him and he turns from it; subsequently he deserts even the chosen few who have remained with him and goes back into solitude.  His message to mankind is: I teach you the Superman .  Man is something that should be overcome.  And: The Superman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: The Superman shall be the meaning of the earth.  And: All gods are dead: now we want the Superman to live – let this be our last will one day at the great noontide! Then: A table of values hangs over every people.  Behold, it is the table of its overcomings; behold, it is the voice of its will to power.  And (in the second part, written in a similar state of excitement in the following June and July): Of Self-Overcoming …Where I found a living creature, there I found will to power…And life itself told me this secret: ‘Behold,’ it said, ‘I am that which must overcome itself again and again ….  Where there is perishing and the falling of leaves, behold, there life sacrifices itself – for the sake of power!…And you too, enlightened man, are only a path and footstep of my will: truly, my will to power walks with the feet of your will to truth!…The living creature values many things higher than life itself; yet out of this evaluation itself speaks – the will to power!’… And (in the third part, written in a state of even greater excitement in January 1884): O my Will!…Preserve me from all petty victories!…That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noontide…a bow eager for its arrow, an arrow eager for its star – a star, ready and ripe in its noontide, glowing, transpierced…Spare me for one great victory! And: Sing and bubble over, O Zarathustra, heal your soul with new songs, so that you may bear your great destiny…behold, you are the teacher of the eternal recurrence …And if you should die now, O Zarathustra: behold, we know too what you would then say to yourself…‘Now I die and decay…and in an instant I shall be nothingness…But the complex of causes in which I am entangled will recur – it will create me again!…I shall return… not to a new life or a better life or a similar life: I shall return eternally to this identical and self-same life…to teach once more the eternal recurrence of all things, to speak once more the teaching of the great noontide of earth and man, to tell man of the Superman once more… Finally: O Man! Attend! What does deep midnight’s voice contend? ‘I slept my sleep, And now awake at dreaming’s end: The world is deep, Deeper than day can comprehend.  Deep is its woe, Joy – deeper than heart’s agony: Woe says: Fade! Go! But all joy wants eternity, –wants deep, deep, deep eternity!’ And, in an immense expansion of this poem, written a year later: Did you ever say Yes to one joy? O my friends, then you said Yes to all woe as well.  All things are chained and entwined together, all things are in love; if you ever wanted one moment twice, if you ever said: ‘You please me, happiness, instant, moment!’ then you wanted everything to return! you wanted everything anew, everything eternal, everything chained, entwined together, everything in love, O that is how you loved the world, you everlasting men, loved it eternally, and for all time: and you say even to woe: ‘Go, but return!’ For all joy wants – eternity ! The Superman, the will to the Superman, the will to power and self-overcoming.  Live dangerously! Amor fati , eternal recurrence, total affirmation of life.  The great noontide.  These are the slogans, the ‘signs’, by which Nietzsche surmounted his nihilism and resolved his crisis.  4 Let’s now try to get to the heart of this book and discover the real meaning of its central concepts.  What is truth? said jesting Pilate; and would not stay for an answer.  If he had stayed, what answer would he have received? There cannot be any doubt: Jesus would have said: I am the truth.  This too is Zarathustra’s answer to the question ‘what is truth?’ For what, at this level, is truth, ‘the truth’? Isn’t it the discovery that no truth is discoverable except the truth which you yourself are? that there is no truth (sense, meaning) in the world except the truth (sense, meaning) you yourself give it ? that ‘truth’ is a concept belonging to the human mind and will and that apart from the human mind and will there is no such thing as ‘truth’? finally, that the resolute determination that your own truth shall be the truth is the sole origin of ‘the truth’ on earth? To give life a meaning: that has been the grand endeavour of all who have preached ‘truth’; for unless life is given a meaning it has none.  At this level, truth is not something that can be proved or disproved: it is something which you determine upon , which, in the language of the old psychology, you will .  It is not something waiting to be discovered, something to which you submit or at which you halt: it is something you create , it is the expression of a particular kind of life and being which has, in you, ventured to assert itself.  Thus Zarathustra declares: ‘The Superman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: The Superman shall be the meaning of the earth.’ He is a prophet, not of the truth that is , but of the truth that shall be .  What determines the nature of ‘truth’? The nature of the I which asserts ‘ I am the truth’.  Why truth, and not rather untruth or indifference to truth? Because each particular life and being needs a fortress within which to preserve and protect itself and from which to reach out in search of aggrandizement and more power, and truth is this fortress.  Or, as life says to thinking mankind: ‘my will to power walks with the feet of your will to truth.’ What then ultimately is the answer to Pilate’s question? It is: truth is will to power.  Thus – by my reading at any rate – spoke Zarathustra.  The great need, the ‘one thing needful’, was to overcome the nihilistic devaluation of life and man which had followed the destruction of the metaphysical world (the ‘death of God’).  This devaluation had been effected chiefly by a psychological theory, namely the theory that primitive drives can be sublimated , so that distinctively human qualities, ‘humane’ qualities, can be understood as sublimated forms of drives which mankind has in common with the animals.  The motive for formulating such a theory was the need to account for what is distinctively human without recourse to the metaphysical or supernatural.  From a very large number of experiments, two primitive drives emerged as dominant: the desire for power and the emotion of fear.  And when Nietzsche came to understand fear as the feeling of the absence of power , he was left with a single motivating principle for all human actions: the will to power.  Sublimated will to power was now the Ariadne’s thread tracing the way out of the labyrinth of nihilism.  ‘A table of values’ – i.e.  a morality – ‘hangs over every people’: it is the table of the self-imposed commands which have turned a herd and rabble into a nation: primitive aggression has been directed back upon itself, sublimated into self -control.  When the same thing happens in an individual, when he imposes commands upon himself, and obeys them, so that he too as it were changes from a rabble into a nation, the result is ‘the Superman’, the man who is master of himself .  But to master oneself is the hardest of all tasks, that which requires the greatest amount of power: he who can do it has experienced the greatest increase in power, and if (as Nietzsche later says explicitly but here implies) happiness (in Zarathustra ‘joy’) is the feeling that power increases, that a resistance is overcome, then the Superman will be the happiest man and, as such, the meaning and justification of existence.  Through continual increase of power to transmute the chaos of life into a continual self-overcoming of life and thus to experience in an ever greater degree the joy which is synonymous with this self-overcoming: that would now be the meaning of life – for joy is to Nietzsche, as it is to commonsense, the one thing that requires no justification, that is its own justification.  He who had attained that joy would affirm life and love it however much pain it contained, because he would know that ‘all things are chained and entwined together’ and that everything is therefore part of a whole which he must accept as a whole .  To express this feeling of life-affirmation Nietzsche formulated a theorem of ‘the eternal recurrence of the same events’ to which he gave rhapsodic expression in Zarathustra .  To be sure, only the Superman could be so well-disposed towards his life as to want it again and again for ever: but that precisely is the reason for willing his creation.  The joy of the Superman in being as he is, now and ever, is the ultimate sublimation of the will to power and the final overcoming of an otherwise inexorable and inevitable nihilism.  5 These conceptions constitute the heart of Thus Spoke Zarathustra ; these, and the extended hymn to solitude and individuality to which the book owes its peculiar tone and pathos.  I have described the process of their formation as an eruption; what I mean is an eruption from the subconscious of ideas belonging to Nietzsche’s earliest years, an eruption brought about by the very fact that at this time he had arrived at the end of the path which led away from them.  He could go no further forward, so he had to go back.  But since he likewise could not retract what he had been asserting for the previous five years, these earliest ideas which now came up again came up transformed and distorted almost beyond recognition.  What is involved is the operation of something like the psychic censor of psychoanalysis: so that I doubt whether Nietzsche himself was altogether aware of the provenance of the grand and grandiose positive conceptions to the elaboration of which he began to apply his exceptional rhetorical gifts.  These ‘earliest ideas’ are of course Christian, and specifically Lutheran.  The teaching of Lutheran Pietism is before all that the events of life are divinely willed and that it is thus impiety to desire that things should be different from what they are: * but the other tenets of Christian belief are naturally also firmly adhered to by Lutherans.  Here, without more ado, are what I take to be the Christian parallels to the conceptions which dominated Nietzsche’s mind during the period from the summer of 1881 to the year January 1883–January 1884, when they found full expression in Zarathustra , Amor fati : Lutheran acceptance of the events of life as divinely willed, with the consequent affirmation of life as such as divine , as a product of the divine will, and the implication that to hate life is blasphemous.  Eternal recurrence : as a consequence of amor fati the extremest formula of life-affirmation, strongly influenced by the Christian concepts of eternal life and the unalterable nature of God: what is, ‘is now and ever shall be, world without end.’ Will to power : divine grace.  The clue to the connexion is the concept of ‘self-overcoming’, which is one of Nietzsche’s terms for sublimation and the hinge upon which the theory of the will to power turns from being a nihilist to a positive and joyful conception.  The corresponding Christian conception is that of unregenerate nature redeemed by the force of God’s grace.  In both conceptions the central idea is that a certain inner quality (grace/sublimated will to power) elevates man (or some men) above the rest of nature.  The pathos with which ‘will to power’ is invested derives to some extent from ‘Thy will be done’ and the juxtaposition of ‘power’ and ‘glory’, together with the Christian doctrine that to God’s will all things are possible.  Live dangerously! : ‘Take up thy Cross, and follow me’ -Christian deprecation of the easy life.  Great noontide : the Second Coming, the Last Judgement, the division of the sheep from the goats, the wheat from the chaff.  Superman : God as creator and ‘highest being’, the ‘Son of Man’ as God, man as the receptacle of divine grace who rejoices at the idea of eternity: the embodiment and actualization of everything regarded as desirable.  What the Christian says of God, Nietzsche says in very nearly the same words of the Superman, namely: ‘Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.’ 6 Zarathustra’s posture as inspired prophet and reader of riddles would itself suggest an atavism in Nietzsche’s mind even if we were unable clearly to identify the earlier stage to which it had reverted.  But it was an atavism whose effect was curative, like an electrical storm that breaks up the cloud and bad weather which has caused it.  The theme of joy in existence, of the self-sufficiency-in-joy of the sovereign individual, of this joyful self-sufficiency as the aim and meaning of life is what finally reigns as the paramount theme of the book: and this theme derives, not from the grand but ultimately overpowering and stifling conceptions of Christianity, but from someone Nietzsche was later to celebrate as an actualization of the Superman: Goethe.  When the sound and wholesome nature of man acts as an entirety, when he feels himself in the world as in a grand, beautiful, worthy and worthwhile whole, when this harmonious comfort affords him a pure, untrammeled delight: then the universe, if it could be sensible of itself, would shout for joy at having attained its goal and wonder at the pinnacle of its own essence and evolution.  For what end is served by all the expenditure of suns and planets and moons, of stars and Milky Ways, of comets and nebula, of worlds evolving and passing away, if at last a happy man does not involuntarily rejoice in his existence? This passage, from Goethe’s essay on Winckelmann (1805), which Nietzsche certainly knew, could stand as the motto of Thus Spoke Zarathustra .  It is the distillation of the great benevolent spirit of Goethe, a spirit Nietzsche called ‘dionysian’ and with which, for all its tremendous difference in emphasis, Zarathustra is in accordance.  7 I now offer a brief survey of Zarathustra chapter by chapter and comment on a few individual points about which the reader may like some enlightenment.  Zarathustra ( Greek Zoroastres) is the founder of the ancient Persian religion, and the book with which he is credited, the Zend-Avesta, is its Bible.  Scholars of the nineteenth century questioned whether Zarathustra existed, as they questioned whether Homer existed (probably a side-effect of ‘evolutionism’): both are now rehabilitated.  Nietzsche protested at the dissolution of Homer: ‘We gain nothing with our theory of the poetising soul of the people, we are always referred back to the poetical individual’ (Homer and Classical Philology , 1869).  So with Zarathustra.  He is conjectured to have lived in the seventh century B.C.  The heart of his religion is a conflict between Ahura Mazda (Ormuzd), the god of light and good, and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman), the god of darkness and evil.  Nietzsche’s explanation of why he appropriated his name for his own hero: I have not been asked, as I should have been asked, what the name Zarathustra means in precisely my mouth, in the mouth of the first immoralist: for what constitutes the tremendous uniqueness of that Persian in history is precisely the opposite of this.  Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the actual wheel in the working of things: the translation of morality into the realm of metaphysics, as force, cause, end-in-itself, is his work.  But this question is itself at bottom its own answer.  Zarathustra created this most fateful of errors, morality: consequently he must also be the first to recognise it.  Not only has he had longer and greater experience here than any other thinker…what is more important is that Zarathustra is more truthful than any other thinker.  His teaching, and his alone, upholds truthfulness as the supreme virtue.…To tell the truth and to shoot well with arrows : that is Persian virtue.  – Have I been understood? The self-overcoming of morality through truthfulness, the self-overcoming of the moralist into his opposite – into me – that is what the name Zarathustra means in my mouth.  (Em Homo) .  The book is very loosely constructed, but it does possess direction and a plot of sorts.  PART ONE.  Prologue , (1) Zarathustra comes down out of solitude, announces (2) that God is dead and (3) preaches God’s successor, the Superman.  Mankind fails to understand him, even when he (4) expounds his beatitudes (cf.  Matthew 5, 3–11) and (5) appeals to their pride by describing the Superman’s antithesis, the ‘Ultimate Man’, the man who sacrifices the future to his own present.  The (6) overtoppling of the tightrope walker (mankind balanced over an abyss) by the buffoon (Zarathustra himself perhaps, an unannounced attraction) brings home to Zarathustra (7) that human existence is ‘uncanny’ (cf.  the second chorus of Antigone : ‘Many things are uncanny, but none more uncanny than man’), and after a bad night (8) he resolves (9) to desert the market place and speak his message only to the individual.  The twenty-two ‘discourses’ which follow are addressed by Zarathustra to his band of disciples.  Five of the discourses are enclosed in a miniature dramatic scene, the remainder are direct address.  Each is an epitome of Nietzsche’s views on the subject in question: 1: the ‘education of the spirit’: self-discipline, independence, creativity (for another account, in quite different language, see Human, All Too Human , Preface to volume I (1886), sections 3–7); 2: ‘negative virtue’, virtue which consists in not doing wrong and which has as its reward ‘peace of soul’; 3: ‘the metaphysical world’ (including a renunciation of his earlier view ( The Birth of Tragedy , 1872) that aesthetic values are the only true values); 4: the relation between mind and body (a prologue to the theory of the will to power); 5: the nature of virtue; 6: its opposite, the ‘criminal instinct’; 7: aphorisms on authorship, happiness and laughter (introduces ‘the Spirit of Gravity’); 8: ‘nobility of soul’; 9: pessimism; 10: ‘Live dangerously!’; II: the State; 12: nausea at mankind, ‘l’ enfer, c’est les autres’; 13: sensuality and its disguises; 14: how to be a true friend; 15: the relativity of moral values (introduces the will to power); 16: critique of ‘love thy neighbour as thyself’; 17: the need for solitude and the danger of solitude; 18: the nature of women; 19: the nature of justice; 20: bad marriages and good ones; 21: bad deaths and good ones.  Over all these discourses hovers Zarathustra’s dictum ‘Man is something that must be overcome.’ The final chapter reverts to the Prologue, to the death of God and the need for the Superman to give significance to the earth; Zarathustra extols the magnanimous man, the man so full of strength and well-being he bestows gifts on others because he has to, and exhorts his disciples to independence.  Then he leaves them.  PART TWO.  Much more various than Part One.  Zarathustra is more of a dramatic character and eight of the twenty-two chapters involve action.  1: corresponds to the Prologue of Part One: Zarathustra’s return; 2: a much-expanded recapitulation of the ‘God is dead’ theme, and the reintroduction of the Superman as God’s successor; 3: pity for mankind and the need to overcome it; 4: organized religion and the priesthood; 5: another essay on virtue, true and false; 6: another essay on nausea at mankind and how to avoid it; 7: another essay on justice and a polemic against revengefulness disguised as justice; 8: philosophy, true and false; 9–11: prose poems, autobiographical, for the most part fretful, plaintive, disgruntled (cf.  Part Three 3–4 and 14–16); 12: the will to power in full; 13: resumes and completes 8; 14: critique of contemporary culture; 16: critique of the contemplative life and the search for ‘pure knowledge’; 16: critique of the scholarly life; 17: critique of the artistic nature; 18: dramatically, the book’s turning-point.  A discourse on revolution and anarchism is allied to an uncommon amount of action and a fantastical story told by sailors.  Zarathustra’s disciples ‘hardly listened’ to his discourse, we are told, because of their anxiety to repeat the sailors’ story, the point of which is that Zarathustra’s alter ego has been seen flying through the air crying ‘It is time! It is high time!’ ‘For what is it high time?’ Zarathustra asks himself when he learns this: the answer (suppressed for the moment but henceforward never absent from his mind) is: ‘Time to declare the eternal recurrence.’; 19: continues the fantastical atmosphere of 18 and intensifies it into nightmare; Zarathustra is now in a nervous and depressed condition very different from the state of ebullient optimism which has chiefly characterized him hitherto; a ‘dark night of the soul’, which persists into Part Three; 20: a discourse on ‘great men’ leads to reflexions on the nature of will in the midst of which Zarathustra is struck dumb when he realizes the implications of what he is saying for the theory of eternal recurrence; 21: on the desirability of masks – a beautifully shaped chapter, in this respect perhaps the finest; but it belongs in spirit earlier in the book, it interrupts the steady descent from 18 to 22, in which Zarathustra, as the consequence of a second nightmare which robs him of all self-confidence and almost of self-control, again deserts his disciples, this time, however, in a mood of profound misery, and this time for good.  PART THREE.  For the most part Zarathustra is alone and addressing himself.  Earlier themes are taken up and woven into a texture which sometimes grows too tight.  Imagery becomes clotted at times.  But the intensity of expression aimed at is superbly achieved and maintained.  1: Zarathustra has just left his disciples and is making his way home, his depression still upon him; 2: on board ship, he expounds the eternal recurrence as a riddle and in language which recalles the nightmare of Part Two 18; although all is still shrouded in obscurity and mystery, that he has now brought himself to raise the veil even to this limited extent is sufficient to restore him to his normal cheerfulness; 3 and 4: prose poems, introspective, cheerful, calm; half way between the melancholy of Part Two 9–11 and the Dionysian ecstasy of Part Three 14–16; 5: back on firm land, Zarathustra experiences again his familiar nausea at mankind; 6: self-portrait of Zarathustra as a solitary; 7: extended exegesis of the text ‘May looking away be my only form of negation!’; 8: polemic against piety; 9: Zarathustra arrives back at his cave: a hymn to solitude; 10: a model ‘revaluation’ of three vices; n: exhortation to cheerfulness; 12–16: the climax of the book, a supreme exhibition of the sustained intellectual passion which gives Nietzsche his place among the world’s great men.  12 is a re-exposition in brief of Zarathustra’s teachings, up to but not including the theory of the eternal recurrence, which is reserved for 13, in which the theory is at last stated in full and without disguise, and joyfully accepted and embraced.  With this act Zarathustra’s self-education reaches its appointed end.  The fulfilment is celebrated with a trilogy of prose poems, 14–16, of great exuberance and intensity.  At this culmination of his course, Zarathustra is, as aforesaid, entirely alone, so that when he wishes to give vent to his feelings of unbounded joy and gratitude in dithyrambic poetry there is no one to whom he can address these dithyrambs except himself.  Thus 14 is addressed to his own soul, 15 to the life he feels within him, 16 to himself in his future reincarnation.  The eternity referred to in 16 is of course the eternal recurrence, and the child he wants to have by ‘eternity’ is – himself.  PART FOUR.  When, in January 1884, he closed his book with Seven Seals, Nietzsche thought Zarathustra was finished.  But in the following winter he took up the theme again, and planned a further three parts.  In the first of them, Zarathustra is visited by sundry ‘higher men’ who, as a consequence of Zarathustra’s instruction, become conscious of their inadequacy.  At the conclusion of this part Zarathustra receives the call to go out into the world again, and in the following part he accumulates a large following, to whom he preaches his now triumphant message.  In the final part he dies, although Nietzsche could not decide in what manner.  Of these three new parts only the first was written, slowly and with interruptions, in the winter of 1884–85.  Nietzsche had it privately printed but withheld it from publication, and it first appeared, as ‘the Fourth and Last Part’ of Zarathustra in 1892, as part of the first collected edition of Nietzsche.  Stylistically, Part Four is quite different from the earlier parts and on a lower level of inspiration.  The ‘higher men’ are at once types and individuals.  The gloomy prophet is Schopenhauer.  The two kings are any kings.  The conscientious man of the spirit is probably Darwin, although any scientific specialist would do.  The sorcerer is Wagner (the sorcerer’s poems are parodies of Wagner’s later poetic manner).  The last pope is of course (as yet) imaginary.  The ugliest man and the shadow are representations of the atheist and the freethinker respectively.  The voluntary beggar is either the Buddha or Tolstoy.  The eternal recurrence remains in the background, but emerges at the conclusion, where it receives its most sonorous and ecstatic affirmation.  June 1969 R.J.H.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Manly Prudence I T is not the height, it is the abyss that is terrible! The abyss where the glance plunges downward and the hand grasps upward .  There the heart grows giddy through its twofold will.  Ah, friends, have you, too, divined my heart’s twofold will? That my glance plunges into the heights and that my hand wants to hold on to the depths and lean there – that, that is my abyss and my danger.  My will clings to mankind, I bind myself to mankind with fetters, because I am drawn up to the Superman: for my other will wants to draw me up to the Superman.  That my hand may not quite lose its belief in firmness: that is why I live blindly among men, as if I did not recognize them.  I do not recognize you men: this darkness and consolation has often spread around me.  I sit at the gateway and wait for every rogue and ask: Who wants to deceive me? This is my first manly prudence: I let myself be deceived so as not to be on guard against deceivers.  Ah, if I were on guard against men, how could men be an anchor for my ball? It would be torn upward and away too easily! This providence lies over my fate: I have to be without foresight.  And he who does not want to die of thirst among men must learn to drink out of all glasses; and he who wants to stay clean among men must know how to wash himself even with dirty water.  And to console myself I often spoke thus: ‘Well then! Come on, old heart! A misfortune failed to harm you: enjoy that as your – good fortune!’ This, however, is my second manly prudence: I am more considerate to the vain than to the proud.  Is wounded vanity not the mother of all tragedies? But where pride is wounded there surely grows up something better than pride.  If life is to be pleasant to watch, its play must be well acted: for that, however, good actors are needed.  I found all vain people to be good actors: they act and desire that others shall want to watch them – all their spirit is in this desire.  They act themselves, they invent themselves; I like to watch life in their vicinity – it cures melancholy.  I am considerate to the vain because they are physicians to my melancholy and hold me fast to mankind as to a play.  And further: who can estimate the full depth of the vain man’s modesty! I love and pity him on account of his modesty.  He wants to learn belief in himself from you; he feeds upon your glances, he eats praise out of your hands.  He believes even your lies when you lie favourably to him: for his heart sighs in its depths: ‘What am I ?’ And if the virtue that is unconscious of itself be the true virtue: well, the vain man is unconscious of his modesty! This, however, is my third manly prudence: I do not let your timorousness spoil my pleasure at the sight of the wicked .  I am happy to see the marvels the hot sun hatches: tigers and palm trees and rattle-snakes.  Among men, too, there is a fine brood of the hot sun and much that is marvellous in the wicked.  Indeed, as your wisest man did not seem so very wise to me, so I found that human wickedness, too, did not live up to its reputation.  And I often shook my head and asked: Why go on rattling, you rattle-snakes? Truly, there is still a future, even for evil! And the hottest South has not yet been discovered for mankind.  How many a thing is now called grossest wickedness which is only twelve feet broad and three months long! One day, however, greater dragons will come into the world.  For, that the Superman may not lack his dragon, the super-dragon worthy of him, much hot sunshine must yet burn upon damp primeval forests! Your wild cats must have become tigers and your poison-toads crocodiles: for the good huntsman shall have a good hunt! And truly, you good and just! There is much in you that is laughable and especially your fear of him who was formerly called the ‘Devil’! Your souls are so unfamiliar with what is great that the Superman would be fearful to you in his goodness! And you wise and enlightened men, you would flee from the burning sun of wisdom in which the Superman joyfully bathes his nakedness! You highest men my eyes have encountered! This is my doubt of you and my secret laughter: I think you would call my Superman – a devil! Alas, I grew weary of these highest and best men: from their ‘heights’ I longed to go up, out, away to the Superman! A horror overcame me when I saw these best men naked: then there grew for me the wings to soar away into distant futures.  Into most distant futures, into more southerly Souths than artist ever dreamed of: thither where gods are ashamed of all clothes! But I want to see you disguised, you neighbours and fellow-men, and well-dressed and vain and worthy as ‘the good and just’.  And I myself will sit among you disguised, so that I may misunderstand you and myself: that, in fact, is my last manly prudence.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Old and Young Women ‘W HY do you slink so shyly through the twilight, Zarathustra? And what are you hiding so carefully under your cloak? ‘Is it a treasure someone has given you? Or a child that has been born to you? Or are you now taking the way of thieves yourself, friend of the wicked?’ Truly, my brother! (said Zarathustra) it is a treasure that has been given me: it is a little truth that I carry.  But it is as unruly as a little child, and if I do not stop its mouth it will cry too loudly.  Today as I was going my way alone, at the hour when the sun sets, a little old woman encountered me and spoke thus to my soul: ‘Zarathustra has spoken much to us women, too, but he has never spoken to us about woman.’ And I answered her: ‘One should speak about women only to men.’ ‘Speak to me too of woman,’ she said; ‘I am old enough soon to forget it.’ And I obliged the little old woman and spoke to her thus: Everything about woman is a riddle, and everything about woman has one solution: it is called pregnancy.  For the woman, the man is a means: the end is always the child.  But what is the woman for the man? The true man wants two things: danger and play.  For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.  Man should be trained for war and woman for the recreation of the warrior: all else is folly.  The warrior does not like fruit that is too sweet.  Therefore he likes woman; even the sweetest woman is still bitter.  Woman understands children better than a man, but man is more childlike than woman.  A child is concealed in the true man: it wants to play.  Come, women, discover the child in man! Let woman be a plaything, pure and fine like a precious stone illumined by the virtues of a world that does not yet exist.  Let the flash of a star glitter in your level Let your hope be: ‘May I bear the Superman!’ Let there be bravery in your love! With your love you should attack him who inspires you with fear.  Let your honour be in your love! Woman has understood little otherwise about honour.  But let this be your honour: always to love more than you are loved and never to be second in this.  Let man fear woman when she loves.  Then she bears every sacrifice and every other thing she accounts valueless.  Let man fear woman when she hates: for man is at the bottom of his soul only wicked, but woman is base.  Whom does woman hate most? – Thus spoke the iron to the magnet: ‘I hate you most, because you attract me, but are not strong enough to draw me towards you.’ The man’s happiness is: I will.  The woman’s happiness is: He will.  ‘Behold, now the world has become perfect!’ – thus thinks every woman when she obeys with all her love.  And woman has to obey and find a depth for her surface.  Woman’s nature is surface, a changeable, stormy film upon shallow waters.  But a man’s nature is deep, its torrent roars in subterranean caves: woman senses its power but does not comprehend it.  Then the little old woman answered me: ‘Zarathustra has said many nice things, especially for those who are young enough for them.  ‘It is strange, Zarathustra knows little of women and yet he is right about them! Is this because with women nothing is impossible? ‘And now accept as thanks a little truth 11 am certainly old enough for it! ‘Wrap it up and stop its mouth: otherwise it will cry too loudly, this little truth!’ ‘Give me your little truth, woman!’ I said.  And thus spoke the little old woman: ‘Are you visiting women? Do not forget your whip!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Conversation with the Kings 1 Z ARATHUSTRA had not been going an hour through his mountains and forests when all at once he saw a strange procession.  Along just that path that he was going down came two kings, adorned with crowns and purple sashes and bright as flamingos: they drove before them a laden ass.  ‘What do these kings want in my kingdom?’ said Zarathustra in astonishment to his heart, and quickly concealed himself behind a bush.  But as the kings drew abreast of him, he said, half aloud like someone talking to himself: ‘Strange! Strange! I cannot make this out! I see two kings – and only one ass!’ Then the two kings halted, smiled, gazed at the place from which the voice had come, and then looked one another in the face.  ‘No doubt people think such things as that at home, too,’ said the king on the right, ‘but they do not utter them.’ The king on the left shrugged his shoulders and answered: ‘It is probably a goat-herd.  Or a hermit who has lived too long among trees and rocks.  For no company at all also corrupts good manners.’ ‘Good manners?’ replied the other king indignantly and bitterly.  ‘What is it we are avoiding, then? Is it not “good manners”? Our “good company”? ‘Truly, better to live among hermits and goat-herds than with our gilded, false, painted rabble – although it calls itself “good company”, ‘although it calls itself “nobility”.  But there everything is false and rotten, most of all the blood, thanks to old, evil diseases and worse quacks.  ‘I think the finest and dearest man today is a healthy peasant, uncouth, cunning, obstinate, enduring: that is the noblest type today.  ‘The peasant is the finest man today; and the peasantry should be master! But ours is the kingdom of the rabble – I no longer let myself be taken in.  Rabble, however, means: hotchpotch.  ‘Rabble-hotchpotch: in that everything is mixed up with everything else, saint and scoundrel and gentleman and Jew and every beast out of Noah’s Ark.  ‘Good manners! Everything is false and rotten with us.  Nobody knows how to be respectful any more: it is from precisely this that we are running away.  They are honey-mouthed, importunate dogs, they gild palm-leaves.  ‘It is this disgust that chokes me, that we kings ourselves have become false, arrayed and disguised in the old, yellowed pomp of our grandfathers, show-pieces for the stupidest and the craftiest and whoever today traffics with power! ‘We are not the first of them – yet we have to pretend to be: we have at last become tired and disgusted with this deception.  ‘Now we are avoiding the mob, all these ranters and scribbling-blue bottles, the stench of shopkeepers, the struggles of ambition, the foul breath: faugh, to live among the mob, ‘faugh, to pretend to be the first among the mob! Ah, disgust! disgust! disgust! What do we kings matter any more!’ ‘Your old illness is assailing you,’ the king on the left said at this point, ‘disgust is assailing you, my poor brother.  But you know that someone can overhear us.’ Hereupon Zarathustra, who had kept his ears and eyes open to these speeches, rose from his hiding-place, stepped towards the kings and began: ‘He who has overheard you, he who likes to overhear you, O kings, is called Zarathustra.  ‘I am Zarathustra, who once said: “What do kings matter any longer!” Forgive me, but I was glad when you said to one another: “What do we kings matter!” ‘This, however, is my kingdom and dominion: what might you be seeking in my kingdom? But perhaps on your way you have found what I am seeking : that is, the Higher Man.’ When the kings heard this they beat their breasts and said in a single voice: ‘We have been recognized! ‘With the sword of these words you have cut through the thickest darkness of our hearts.  You have discovered our distress, for behold! we are on our way to find the Higher Man – ‘the man who is higher than we: although we are kings.  We are leading this ass to him.  For the Highest Man shall also be the highest lord on earth.  ‘There is no harder misfortune in all human destiny than when the powerful of the earth are not also the first men.  Then everything becomes false and awry and monstrous.  ‘And when they are even the last men and more beast than man, then the value of the rabble rises higher and higher and at last the rabble-virtue says: Behold, I alone am virtue!’ ‘What do I hear?’ answered Zarathustra; ‘what wisdom from kings! I am enchanted, and truly, I already feel the urge to compose a verse about it: ‘even if it should be a verse not suited to everyone’s ears.  I long ago unlearned consideration for long ears.  Very well! Come on! (But here it happened that the ass, too, found speech: it said clearly and maliciously ‘Ye-a’.) ‘Once on a time – ’twas A.D.  One, I think – Thus spoke the Sybil, drunken without drink: “How bad things go! Decay! Decay! Ne’er sank the world so low! Rome is now a harlot and a brothel too, Rome’s Caesar’s a beast, and God himself – a Jew!”’ 2 The kings were delighted with these lines of Zarathustra’s; and the king on the right said: ‘O Zarathustra, how well we did to come out and see you! ‘For your enemies have shown us your image in their mirror, from which you gazed with the grimace of a devil and with mocking laughter, so that we were afraid of you.  ‘But what good was it! Again and again you stung our ears and hearts with your sayings.  Then at last we said: What does it matter how he looks! ‘We must hear him, him who teaches: You should love peace as a means to new wars and a short peace more than a long! ‘No one ever spoke such warlike words: What is good? To be brave is good.  It is the good war that hallows every cause.  ‘O Zarathustra, at such words the blood of our fathers stirred in our bodies: it was like spring speaking to old wine-casks.  ‘Our fathers loved life when swords were crossed like red-flecked serpents; they thought all suns of peace faint and feeble, but the long peace made them ashamed.  ‘How they sighed, our fathers, when they saw resplendent, parched swords upon the wall! Like them, they thirsted for war.  For a sword wants to drink blood and sparkles with its desire.’ As the kings thus eagerly talked and babbled of the happiness of their fathers, Zarathustra was overcome by no small desire to mock their eagerness: for they were apparently very peaceable kings that he saw before him, with aged, refined faces.  But he controlled himself.  ‘Very well!’ he said, ‘yonder leads the way to Zarathustra’s cave; and this day shall have a long evening! But now a cry of distress calls me hurriedly away from you.  ‘My cave will be honoured if kings would sit and wait in it: but, to be sure, you will have to wait a long time! ‘But really! What does it matter! Where today does one learn to wait better than in courts? And the whole virtue still remaining to kings – is it not today called: being able to wait!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Second Dance Song 1 L ATELY I gazed into your eyes, O Life: I saw gold glittering in your eyes of night – my heart stood still with delight: I saw a golden bark glittering upon dark waters, a submerging, surging, re-emerging golden tossing bark! At my feet, my dancing-mad feet, you threw a glance, a laughing, questioning, melting tossing glance: Twice only did you raise your castanets in your little hands – then my feet were already tossing in a mad dance.  My heels raised themselves, my toes listened for what you should propose: for the dancer wears his ears – in his toes! I sprang to your side: then you fled back from my spring; towards me the tongues of your fleeing, flying hair came hissing! Away from you and from your serpents did I retire: then at once you stood, half turned, your eyes full of desire.  With your crooked smile – you teach me crooked ways, upon crooked ways my feet learn – guile! I fear you when you are near, I love you when you are far; your fleeing allures me, your seeking secures me: I suffer, but for you what would I not gladly endure! For you whose coldness inflames, whose hatred seduces, whose flight constrains, whose mockery – induces: who would not hate you, great woman who binds us, en-winds us, seduces us, seeks us, finds us I Who would not love you, you innocent, impatient, wind-swift, child-eyed sinner! Where now do you take me, you unruly paragon? And again you forsake me, you sweet, ungrateful tomboy! I dance after you, I follow you even when only the slightest traces of you linger.  Where are you? Give me your hand I Or just a finger! Here are caves and thickets: we shall go astray! Stop! Stand still! Do you not see owls and bats flitting away? Would you befool me? You bat! You owl! Where are we? Did you learn from the dogs thus to bark and howl? Your little white teeth you sweetly bare at me, from under your curly little mane your wicked eyes stare at me! This is a dance over dale and hill: I am the hunter – will you be my hound or will you be my kill? Now beside me! And quickly, you wicked rover I Now spring up! And across! – Help! In springing! myself have gone over! Oh see me lying, you wanton companion, and begging for grace! I long to follow you in – a sweeter chase! – love’s chase through flowery bushes, still and dim! Or there beside the lake, where goldfishes dance and swim! Are you now weary? There yonder are sheep and evening: let us end our pursuit: is it not sweet to sleep when the shepherd plays his flute? Are you so very weary? I will carry you there, just let your arms sink! And if you are thirsty – I should have something, but you would not like it to drink! – Oh this accursed, nimble, supple snake and slippery witch! Where have you gone? But on my face I feel from your hand two spots and blotches itch! I am truly weary of being your shepherd, always sheepish and meek! You witch, if I have hitherto sung for you, now for me you shall – shriek! To the rhythm of my whip you shall shriek and trot! Did I forget my whip? – I did not! 2 Then Life answered me thus, keeping her gentle ears closed: ‘O Zarathustra! Do not crack your whip so terribly! You surely know: noise kills thought – and now such tender thoughts are coming to me.  ‘We are both proper ne’er-do-wells and ne’er-do-ills.  Beyond good and evil did we discover our island and our green meadow – we two alone! Therefore we must love one another! ‘And even if we do not love one another from the very heart, do people have to dislike one another if they do not love one another from the very heart? ‘And that I love you and often love you too well, that I know: and the reason is that I am jealous of your Wisdom.  Ah, this crazy old fool, Wisdom! ‘If your Wisdom should one day desert you, alas! then my love would quickly desert you too.’ Thereupon, Life gazed thoughtfully behind her and around her and said gently: ‘O Zarathustra, you are not faithful enough to me! ‘You do not love me nearly as much as you say; I know you are thinking of leaving me soon.  ‘There is an old, heavy, heavy booming bell: it booms out at night up to your cave: ‘when you hear this bell beat the hour at midnight, then you think between one and twelve – ‘you think, O Zarathustra, I know it, you think of leaving me soon!’ ‘Yes,’ I answered hesitatingly, ‘but you also know….’ And I said something into her ear, in the midst of her tangled, yellow, foolish locks.  ‘You know that, O Zarathustra? No one knows that.’ And we gazed at one another and looked out at the green meadow, over which the cool evening was spreading, and wept together.  But then Life was dearer to me than all my Wisdom had ever been.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  3 One! O Man! Attend! Two! What does deep midnight’s voice contend? Three ! ‘I slept my sleep, Four! ‘And now awake at dreaming’s end: Five ! ‘The world is deep, Six! ‘Deeper than day can comprehend.  Seven ! ‘Deep is its woe, Eight! ‘Joy – deeper than heart’s agony: Nine ! ‘Woe says: Fade! Go! Ten! ‘But all joy wants eternity, Eleven! ‘ – wants deep, deep, deep eternity!’ Twelve! Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Sign O N the morning after this night, however, Zarathustra sprang up from his bed, girded his loins, and emerged from his cave, glowing and strong, like a morning sun emerging from behind dark mountains.  ‘Great star,’ he said, as he had said once before, ‘you profound eye of happiness, what would all your happiness be if you did not have those for whom you shine! ‘And if they remained in their rooms while you were already awake and had come, giving and distributing: how angry your proud modesty would be! ‘Very well! they are still asleep, these Higher Men, while I am awake: they are not my rightful companions! It is not for them I am waiting in my mountains.  ‘I want to go to my work, to my day: but they do not understand what are the signs of my morning, my step -is no awakening call for them.  ‘They are still sleeping in my cave, their dream still drinks at my intoxicated songs.  Yet the ear that listens to me , the obeying ear, is missing from them.’ Zarathustra had said this to his heart when the sun rose: then he looked inquiringly aloft, for he heard above him the sharp cry of his eagle.  ‘Very well!’ he cried up, ‘so do I like it, so do I deserve it.  My animals are awake, for I am awake.  ‘My eagle is awake and, like me, does honour to the sun.  With eagle’s claws it reaches out for the new light.  You are my rightful animals: I love you.  ‘But I still lack my rightful men!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra; then, however, he suddenly heard that he was surrounded by countless birds, swarming and fluttering – the whirring of so many wings and the throng about his head, however, were so great that he shut his eyes.  And truly, it was as if a cloud had fallen upon him, a cloud of arrows discharged over a new enemy.  And behold, in this case it was a cloud of love, and over a new friend.  ‘What is happening to me?’ thought Zarathustra, in his astonished heart, and slowly lowered himself on to the great stone that lay beside the exit of his cave.  But, as he was clutching about, above and underneath himself, warding off the tender birds, behold, then something even stranger occurred: for in doing so he clutched unawares a thick, warm mane of hair; at the same time, however, a roar rang out in front of him – the gentle, protracted roar of a lion.  ‘The sign has come ’ said Zarathustra, and his heart was transformed.  And in truth, when it grew clear before him, there lay at his feet a sallow, powerful animal that lovingly pressed its head against his knee and would not leave him, behaving like a dog that has found his old master again.  The doves, however, were no less eager than the lion with their love; and every time a dove glided across the lion’s nose, the lion shook its head and wondered and laughed.  While this was happening, Zarathustra said but one thing: ‘My children are near, my children ’ then he grew quite silent.  His heart, however, was loosened, and tears fell from his eyes down upon his hands.  And he no longer paid attention to anything, and sat there motionless and no longer warding off the animals.  Then the doves flew back and forth and sat upon his shoulder and fondled his white hair and did not weary of tenderness and rejoicing.  The mighty lion, however, continually licked the tears that fell down upon Zarathustra’s hands, roaring and growling shyly as he did so.  Thus did these animals.  All this lasted a long time, or a short time: for, properly speaking, there is no time on earth for such things.  In the meantime, however, the Higher Men in Zarathustra’s cave had awakened and arranged themselves for a procession, that they might go to Zarathustra and offer him their morning greeting: for they had discovered when they awoke that he was no longer among them.  But when they reached the door of the cave, and the sound of their steps preceded them, the lion started violently, suddenly turned away from Zarathustra, and leaped up to the cave, roaring fiercely; the Higher Men, however, when they heard its roaring, all cried out as with a single throat and fled back and in an instant had vanished.  But Zarathustra himself, bewildered and spell-bound, raised himself from his seat, gazed about him, stood there amazed, questioned his heart, recollected, and saw he was alone.  ‘What was it I heard?’ he slowly said at last, ‘what has just happened to me?’ And at once his memory returned and he comprehended in a glance all that had happened between yesterday and today.  ‘This here is the stone,’ he said and stroked his beard, ‘on this did I sit yesterday morning; and here did the prophet come to me, and here I first heard the cry which I heard even now, the great cry of distress.  ‘O you Higher Men, it was of your distress that old prophet prophesied to me yesterday morning, ‘he tried to seduce and tempt me to your distress: O Zarathustra, he said to me, I have come to seduce you to your ultimate sin.  ‘To my ultimate sin?’ cried Zarathustra and laughed angrily at his own words.  ‘What has been reserved for me as my ultimate sin?’ And once more Zarathustra became absorbed in himself and sat himself again on the great stone and meditated.  Suddenly, he leaped up - ‘Pity! Pity for the Higher Man !’ he cried out, and his countenance was transformed into brass.  ‘Very well! That – has had its time! ‘My suffering and my pity – what of them! For do I aspire after happiness? I aspire after my work ! ‘Very well! The lion has come, my children are near, Zarathustra has become ripe, my hour has come! ‘This is my morning, my day begins: rise up now, rise up, great noontide!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra and left his cave, glowing and strong, like a morning sun emerging from behind dark mountains.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Bestowing Virtue 1 W HEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was attached and which was called ‘The Pied Cow’ there followed him many who called themselves his disciples and escorted him.  Thus they came to a cross-road: there Zarathustra told them that from then on he wanted to go alone: for he was a friend of going-alone.  But his disciples handed him in farewell a staff, upon the golden haft of which a serpent was coiled about a sun.  Zarathustra was delighted with the staff and leaned upon it; then he spoke thus to his disciples: Tell me: how did gold come to have the highest value? Because it is uncommon and useless and shining and mellow in lustre; it always bestows itself.  Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold come to have die highest value.  Gold-like gleams the glance of the giver.  Gold-lustre makes peace between moon and sun.  The highest virtue is uncommon and useless, it is shining and mellow in lustre: the highest virtue is a bestowing virtue.  Truly, I divine you well, my disciples, you aspire to the bestowing virtue, as I do.  What could you have in common with cats and wolves? You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves; and that is why you thirst to heap up all riches in your soul.  Your soul aspires insatiably after treasures and jewels, because your virtue is insatiable in wanting to give.  You compel all things to come to you and into you, that they may flow back from your fountain as gifts of your love.  Truly, such a bestowing love must become a thief of all values; but I call this selfishness healthy and holy.  There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor, a hungry selfishness that always wants to steal, that selfishness of the sick, the sick selfishness.  It looks with the eye of a thief upon all lustrous things; with the greed of hunger it measures him who has plenty to eat; and it is always skulking about the table of the givers.  Sickness speaks from such craving, and hidden degeneration; the thieving greed of this longing speaks of a sick body.  Tell me, my brothers: what do we account bad and the worst of all? Is it not degeneration? – And we always suspect degeneration where the bestowing soul is lacking.  Our way is upward, from the species across to the super-species.  But the degenerate mind which says ‘All for me’ is a horror to us.  Our mind flies upward: thus it is an image of our bodies, an image of an advance and elevation.  The names of the virtues are such images of advances and elevations.  Thus the body goes through history, evolving and battling.  And the spirit – what is it to the body? The herald, companion, and echo of its battles and victories.  All names of good and evil are images: they do not speak out, they only hint.  He is a fool who seeks knowledge from them.  Whenever your spirit wants to speak in images, pay heed; for that is when your virtue has its origin and beginning.  Then your body is elevated and risen up; it enraptures the spirit with its joy, that it may become creator and evaluator and lover and benefactor of all things.  When your heart surges broad and full like a river, a blessing and a danger to those who live nearby: that is when your virtue has its origin and beginning.  When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to command all things as the will of a lover: that is when your virtue has its origin and beginning.  When you despise the soft bed and what is pleasant and cannot make your bed too far away from the soft-hearted: that is when your virtue has its origin and beginning.  When you are the willers of a single will, and you call this dispeller of need your essential and necessity: that is when your virtue has its origin and beginning.  Truly, it is a new good and evil! Truly, a new roaring in the depths and the voice of a new fountain! It is power, this new virtue; it is a ruling idea, and around it a subtle soul: a golden sun, and around it the serpent of knowledge.  2 Here Zarathustra fell silent a while and regarded his disciples lovingly.  Then he went on speaking thus, and his voice was different: Stay loyal to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue! May your bestowing love and your knowledge serve towards the meaning of the earth! Thus I beg and entreat you.  Do not let it fly away from the things of earth and beat with its wings against the eternal walls! Alas, there has always been much virtue that has flown away! Lead, as I do, the flown-away virtue back to earth – yes, back to body and life: that it may give the earth its meaning, a human meaning! A hundred times hitherto has spirit as well as virtue flown away and blundered.  Alas, all this illusion and blundering still dwells in our bodies: it has there become body and will.  A hundred times has spirit as well as virtue experimented and gone astray.  Yes, man was an experiment.  Alas, much ignorance and error has become body in us! Not only the reason of millennia – the madness of millennia too breaks out in us.  It is dangerous to be an heir.  We are still fighting step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto the senseless, the meaningless, has still ruled over mankind.  May your spirit and your virtue serve the meaning of the earth, my brothers: and may the value of all things be fixed anew by you.  To that end you should be fighters! To that end you should be creators! The body purifies itself through knowledge; experimenting with knowledge it elevates itself; to the discerning man all instincts are holy; the soul of the elevated man grows joyful.  Physician, heal yourself: thus you will heal your patient too.  Let his best healing-aid be to see with his own eyes him who makes himself well.  There are a thousand paths that have never yet been trodden, a thousand forms of health and hidden islands of life.  Man and man’s earth are still unexhausted and undiscovered.  Watch and listen, you solitaries! From the future come winds with a stealthy flapping of wings; and good tidings go out to delicate ears.  You solitaries of today, you who have seceded from society, you shall one day be a people: from you, who have chosen out yourselves, shall a chosen people spring – and from this chosen people, the Superman.  Truly, the earth shall yet become a house of healing! And already a new odour floats about it, an odour that brings health – and a new hope! 3 When Zarathustra had said these words he paused like one who has not said his last word; long he balanced the staff doubtfully in his hand.  At last he spoke thus, and his voice was different: I now go away alone, my disciples! You too now go away and be alone! So I will have it.  Truly, I advise you: go away from me and guard yourselves against Zarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.  The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.  One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil.  And why, then, should you not pluck at my laurels? You respect me; but how if one day your respect should tumble? Take care that a falling statue does not strike you dead! You say you believe in Zarathustra? But of what importance is Zarathustra? You are my believers: but of what importance are all believers? You had not yet sought yourselves when you found me.  Thus do all believers; therefore all belief is of so little account.  Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have all denied me will I return to you.  Truly, with other eyes, my brothers, I shall then seek my lost ones; with another love I shall then love you.  And once more you shall have become my friends and children of one hope: and then I will be with you a thud time, that I may celebrate the great noontide with you.  And this is the great noontide: it is when man stands at the middle of his course between animal and Superman and celebrates his journey to the evening as his highest hope: for it is the journey to a new morning.  Then man, going under, will bless himself; for he will be going over to Superman; and the sun of his knowledge will stand at noontide.  ‘ All gods are dead: now we want the Superman to live ’ – let this be our last will one day at the great noontide! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra PART TWO ‘ – and only when you have all denied me will I return to you .  ‘ Truly, with other eyes, my brothers, I shall then seek my lost ones,’ with another love I shall then love you .  ’ ZARATHUSTRA: ‘ Of the Bestowing Virtue ’ The Child with the Mirror T HEN Zarathustra went back into the mountains and into the solitude of his cave and withdrew from mankind: waiting like a sower who has scattered his seed.  His soul, however, became full of impatience and longing for those whom he loved: for he still had much to give them.  This, indeed, is the most difficult thing: to close the open hand out of love and to preserve one’s modesty as a giver.  Thus months and years passed over the solitary; but his wisdom increased and caused him pain by its abundance.  One morning, however, he awoke before dawn, deliberated long upon his bed, and at length spoke to his heart: Why was I so frightened in my dream that I awoke? Did not a child carrying a mirror come to me? ‘O Zarathustra,’ the child said to me, ‘look at yourself in the mirror!’ But when I looked into the mirror I cried out and my heart was shaken: for I did not see myself, I saw the sneer and grimace of a devil.  Truly, I understand the dream’s omen and warning all too well: my doctrine is in danger, weeds want to be called wheat! My enemies have grown powerful and have distorted the meaning of my doctrine, so that my dearest ones are ashamed of the gifts I gave them.  My friends are lost to me; the hour has come to seek my lost ones! With these words Zarathustra sprang up – not, however, as if gasping for air, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit has moved.  His eagle and his serpent regarded him with amazement: for a dawning happiness lit up his face like the dawn.  What has happened to me, my animals? (said Zarathustra).  Have I not changed? Has bliss not come to me like a storm-wind? My happiness is foolish and it will speak foolish things: it is still too young – so be patient with ill My happiness has wounded me: all sufferers shall be physicians to me! I can go down to my friends again and to my enemies too! Zarathustra can speak and give again, and again show love to those he loves.  My impatient love overflows in torrents down towards morning and evening.  My soul streams into the valleys out of silent mountains and storms of grief.  I have desired and gazed into the distance too long.  I have belonged to solitude too long: thus I have forgotten how to be silent.  I have become nothing but speech and the tumbling of a brook from high rocks: I want to hurl my words down into the valleys.  And let my stream of love plunge into impassable and pathless places! How should a stream not find its way to the sea at last! There is surely a lake in me, a secluded, self-sufficing lake; but my stream of love draws it down with it – to the sea! I go new ways, a new speech has come to me; like all creators, I have grown weary of the old tongues.  My spirit no longer wants to walk on worn-out soles.  All speech runs too slowly for me – I leap into your chariot, storm! And even you! will whip on with my venom! I want to sail across broad seas like a cry and a shout of joy, until I find the Blissful Islands where my friends are waiting – And my enemies with them! How I now love anyone to whom I can simply speak! My enemies too are part of my happiness.  And when I want to mount my wildest horse, it is my spear that best helps me on to it; it is an ever-ready servant to my foot – The spear which I throw at my enemies! How I thank my enemies that at last I can throw it! The tension of my cloud has been too great: between laughter-peals of lightning I want to cast hail showers into the depths.  Mightily then my breast will heave, mightily it will blow its storm away over the mountains: and so it will win relief.  Truly, my happiness and my freedom come like a storm! But my enemies shall think the Evil One is raging over their heads.  Yes, you too, my friends, will be terrified by my wild wisdom; and perhaps you will flee from it together with my enemies.  Ah, if only I knew how to lure you back with shepherds’ flutes! Ah, if only my lioness Wisdom had learned to roar fondly! And we have already learned so much with one another! My wild Wisdom became pregnant upon lonely mountains; upon rough rocks she bore her young, her youngest.  Now she runs madly through the cruel desert and seeks and seeks for the soft grassland – my old, wild Wisdom! Upon the soft grassland of your hearts, my friends! – upon your love she would like to bed her dearest one! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Great Longing O MY soul, I taught you to say ‘today’ as well as ‘once’ and ‘formerly’ and to dance your dance over every Here and There and Over-there.  O my soul, I rescued you from all corners, I brushed dust, spiders, and twilight away from you.  O my soul, I washed the petty shame and corner-virtue away from you and persuaded you to stand naked before the eyes of the sun.  With the storm which is called ‘spirit’ I blew across your surging sea; I blew all clouds away, I killed even that killer-bird 40 called ‘sin’.  O my soul, I gave you the right to say No like the storm and to say Yes as the open sky says Yes: now, silent as light you stand, and you pass through denying storms.  O my soul, I gave you back freedom over created and uncreated things: and who knows as you know the delight of things to come? O my soul, I taught you contempt that comes not as the gnawing of a worm, the great, the loving contempt which loves most where it despises most.  O my soul, I taught you so to persuade that you persuade the elements themselves to come to you: like the sun that persuades the sea to rise even to its height.  O my soul, I took from you all obeying, knee-bending, and obsequiousness; I myself gave you the names ‘Dispeller of Care’ and ‘Destiny’.  O my soul, I gave you new names and many-coloured toys, I called you ‘destiny’ and ‘encompassment of encompassments’ and ‘time’s umbilical cord’ and ‘azure bell’.  O my soul, I gave your soil all wisdom to drink, all new wines and also all immemorially ancient strong wines of wisdom.  O my soul, I poured every sun and every night and every silence and every longing upon you: – then you grew up for me like a vine.  O my soul, now you stand superabundant and heavy, a vine with swelling udders and close-crowded golden-brown wine-grapes: oppressed and weighed down by your happiness, expectant from abundance and yet bashful because of your expectancy.  O my soul, now there is nowhere a soul more loving and encompassing and spacious! Where could future and past be closer together than with you? O my soul, I have given you everything and my hands have become empty through you: and now! now you ask me smiling and full of melancholy: ‘Which of us owes thanks? ‘does the giver not owe thanks to the receiver for receiving? Is giving not a necessity? Is taking not – compassion?’ O my soul, I understand the smile of your melancholy: your superabundance itself now stretches out longing hands! Your fullness looks out over raging seas and searches and waits; the longing of over-fullness gazes out of the smiling heaven of your eyes! And truly, O my soul I Who could behold your smile and not dissolve into tears? The angels themselves dissolve into tears through the over-kindness of your smile.  It is your kindness and over-kindness that wishes not to complain and weep: and yet your smile longs for tears, O my soul, and your trembling mouth for sobs.  ‘Is all weeping not a complaining? And all complaining not an accusing?’ Thus you speak to yourself, and because of that, O my soul, you will rather smile than pour forth your sorrow, pour forth in gushing tears all your sorrow at your fullness and at all the desire of the vine for the vintager and the vine-knife! But if you will not weep nor alleviate in weeping your purple melancholy, you will have to sing , O my soul! Behold, I smile myself, who foretold you this: to sing with an impetuous song, until all seas grow still to listen to your longing, until, over still, longing seas, the boat glides, the golden marvel around whose gold all good, bad, marvellous things leap: and many great and small beasts also, and everything that has light, marvellous feet that can run upon violet paths, towards the golden marvel, the boat of free will, and to its master: he, however, is the vintager who waits with diamond-studded vine-knife, your great redeemer, O my soul, the nameless one for whom only future songs will find a name! And truly, your breath is already fragrant with future songs, already you glow and dream, already you drink thirstily from all deep, resounding wells of comfort, already your melancholy reposes in the bliss of future songs! O my soul, now I have given you everything and even the last thing I had to give, and my hands have become empty through you: – that I bade you sing , behold, that was the last thing I had to give! That I bade you sing, now say, say: Which of us now – owes thanks? But better still: sing for me, sing, O my soul! And let me pay thanks! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra NOTES 1 .  Untergeben has three meanings: to descend or go down; to set (as of the sun); and to be destroyed or to go under.  There is much play upon this triple meaning throughout the book.  The noun Untergang is treated in a similar way.  2 .  Übergang und Untergang .  The antithesis über (over) and unter (under) is very frequently employed.  It is not always possible to bring this out fully in translation.  3 .  Rede = discourse; Vorrede = prologue.  The play on words is lost in translation.  4 .  Breeber = breaker; Verbrecher normally = criminal.  ‘Law-breaker’ retains the verbal repetition.  5 .  Hintenveltler is a coinage meaning ‘those who believe in an after life’.  It gains force from its similarity to the word Hinter-wäldler = backwoodsmen.  6 .  The Danish writer Soren Kierkegaard (1813–55), who advocated a return to Christianity by means of a ‘leap’ from unbelief into belief, is perhaps being criticized here.  Much in this chapter reads like a refutation of Kierkegaard.  7 .  The phrase derives from the expression Mit dem Kopfe durch die Wand wollen = to run full tilt at everything.  8 .  Geist means spirit, mind, and intellect – the human under standing.  I have generally rendered it as spirit because this seems to me to include intellect and mind while intellect is too narrow in meaning and understanding too cumbrous for the contexts in which Geist occurs.  In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Geist never has any supernatural connotation.  Where spirit in the sense of soul (Seele) is intended, I have used the word soul.  9 .  Denken = to think, bedenklich = suspicious – a neat play upon words lost in translation.  10 .  The people referred to are the Persians.  The two following are the Jews and the Germans.  11 .  Nächsten = neighbour and nearest, and throughout this chapter Ferruten (= the most distant), the opposite of nearest, is also made to mean the opposite of neighbour, i.e.  the people of the most distant future.  Hence the continual antithesis between “neighbour’ and ‘most distant’ – an antithesis not quite so clear in translation as in the original.  12 .  An untranslatable pun.  ‘To give a person a paw’ means to strike him across the hand with a cane.  13 .  There is a play upon words here that can hardly be transmitted in translation.  ‘ Nicht nur fort sollst du dich pflanzen, sondern binauf!’ ‘Fortpflanzen ’ means to propagate (biological) and to trans plant (botanical); ‘ binpflanzen ’ means to plant out (in the sense of planting out cuttings from a single, original plant).  The sentence means: You should not only propagate yourself, transplant your self in the future just as you are; you should see to it that your children are something higher and less confined than you.  14 .  The reference is to the first line of the final verse of Goethe’s Faust Part Two: All that is transitory is but an image.  See also note 19.  15 .  In German gerecht (just) and geräcbt (revenged) are pronounced identically.  16 .  Hoch und steil leben means literally to live in a high and steep place, figuratively to live nobly and boldly.  17 .  Blicke = glances; Augenblicke = moments.  But by a quibble ‘Augenblicke ’ can be made to mean ‘glances of the eyes’ (Augen — eyes).  This word-play is lost in translation.  18 .  ‘Doer’ is in German (in this case) Handelnden – giving a play upon the word ‘hand’.  19 .The final ‘Mystic Chorus’ of Goethe’s Faust Part Two is burlesqued in this chapter.  Verbal references to it will be clear from the following literal translation: All that is transitory Is but an image; The unattainable Here becomes reality; The indescribable Here it is done! The eternal-womanly Draws up upward! 20 .  The Wanderer and his Shadow is the title of one of Nietzsche’s books (the Third Part of Human, All Too Human) .  21 .  The prophet is Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), who also appears in Part Four.  22 .  Gedanken und Hintergedanken : the antithesis is lost in translation.  23 .  Bucklichte = hunchback; bucklicht reden = to speak crossly.  24 .  Grund = ground and reason.  The pun is amplified in ‘foreground’ (superficial reasons) and ‘background’ (fundamental reasons).  25 .  This scene is a memory from Nietzsche’s childhood.  Nietzsche’s father died following a fall, and it seems that Nietzsche was attracted to the scene by the frightened barking of a dog: he found his father lying unconscious.  It is not entirely clear why the scene should have been evoked at this point.  The most likely suggestion is that Nietzsche at one time thought that events recurred within historical time, and was troubled by the idea that he might meet the same death as his father.  (The idea seems to have assumed the nature of an obsession: its origin probably lay in Nietszche’s fear of madness, which was strengthened by the fact that his father died insane.  The insanity was caused by the fall, but Nietzsche was probably doubtful whether the fall did not merely bring to the surface an inherited weakness.) This old idea may have come into the author’s mind at this point, and have been included in the text as a cryptic ‘history’ of the theory of the eternal recurrence.  What follows is, of course, symbolic and not actual.  26 .  For ‘accepted his destiny’ the author here uses the idiom ‘stood upon his destiny’, giving point to the words ‘with firm feet’, which in translation may seem puzzling.  27 .  Himmel means both ‘sky’ and ‘heaven’.  28 .  Von Ohngefähr means ‘by chance’ – but the author treats the noun as a proper name and ennobles it by adding ‘von ’, the ordinary designation of nobility.  29 .  I have left this paragraph as it stands because a properly idiomatic translation would alter the original more than is justified.  Es gibt sich , as well as meaning ‘it is given’, is employed idiomatically to mean ‘it will get better’, or simply as the verbal equivalent of a shrug of the shoulders.  Es nimmt sich – ‘it is taken’ – has no such idiomatic connotation, and is employed by the author simply as an (untranslatable) antithesis to es gibt sich .  30 .  A pun on the two meanings of Geist – spirit and intellect.  31 .  Dämmerten – a scornful reference to Wagner’s Gotter- dämmerung (The Twilight of the Gods).  32 .  The bray of an ass is rendered in German la (pronounced ee-ah), which sounds and looks very much like Ja = yes.  I have adopted Thomas Common’s translation of this as ‘Ye-a’ (the best that can be done, I think).  Thomas Common always translates Ja as ‘yea’, in accordance with the notion that Thus Spoke Zarathustra is mock-Biblical throughout.  The author employs this humorous device to great effect in Part Four.  33 .  The imagery of this section derives from the saying Waster bat keine Balken = Water is not planked over, Praise the sea but keep on dry land.  Im Fluss means ‘in flux’, but also ‘in the river’ and ‘flowing’.  Later in the same section, ‘Have not all railings and gangways fallen into the water and come to nothing’ refers to the expression ins Wasser fallen , which means to melt away, to come to nothing, as well as, literally, to fall into the water.  This method of reducing an abstract idea to a concrete image by means of everyday idioms is of the essence of Nietzsche’s art – and one reason why the vividness of his style is often dimmed in translation.  34 .  A play upon Vorspiel = prologue, and Beispiel = example.  35 .  A play upon Unterbalt = maintenance, and Unterbaltung = entertainment.  36 .  A play upon Eheschliessen = marriage contract, and Ehebrechen = literally marriage breaking, usually adultery.  The literal meaning of Ehebrechen is played upon in the following paragraphs.  37 .  A play upon Versprechen = promise, and Verseben = mistake.  The words balance one another because sprecben by itself means’ to speak’, and seben means’ to see’.  38 .  A play, frequent in Thus Spoke Zarathustra , upon versuchen = to experiment, to attempt, and suchen = to seek.  39 .  A malicious reference to the opening of Act Three of Wagner’s Siegfried , in which the Wanderer (Wotan) calls up Erda, the Earth Mother, from her sleep, and after a fifteen-minute colloquy bids her return to sleep, The style of this whole passage imitates that of the Wanderer’s summons.  40 .  Würgerin is the feminine form of ‘strangler’ or ‘throttler’; but the word also means the ‘shrike’.  It is in the feminine form because die Sünde = sin, is feminine.  41 .  A play upon Geduld = patience, and dulden = to endure, to suffer in patience.  42 .  A play upon two meanings of Probe : ‘proof or test’ and ‘exhibition’.  43 .  Verstuben means both’ to test’ and’ to tempt’.  44 .  Unter vier Augen gesprochen = between ourselves (literally ‘spoken beneath four eyes’).  The last pope, however, is blind in one eye.  45 .  A play upon verfolgen = to persecute, andfolgea = to follow.  46 .  A play upon Suchung = seeking, Heim = home, and Helm- suchung = affliction.  47 .  Reif means both ‘ring’ and ‘ripe’.  48 .  Tagedieb (lazy bones) means literally ‘thief of daytime’.  49 .  A play upon the similar sound of deutscb = German, and deutlich = clearly.  Deutschreden , used idiomatically, means ‘to speak clearly’ (compare ‘in plain English’).  50 .  Abendmahl , the word employed here and in the title of the chapter, is an old form of Abendessen , that is, ‘supper’.  But it is also the normal word for ‘Holy Communion’, which is of course an imitation of Christ’s last meal with his followers, called in English ‘The Last Supper’.  The pun upon ‘supper’ and ‘Holy Communion’ is not translatable, except perhaps in the way I have attempted.  51 .  A play upon Sprünge = leaps, and Seitensprunge = literally ‘side leaps’, idiomatically ‘escapades’.  52 .  Ich kann nicbt anders, Gott belfe atirl — Luther’s famous words before the Diet of Worms.  53 .  Leib-Farbe means literally ‘body colour’, but idiomatically ‘favourite colour’.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Cry of Distress T HE following day Zarathustra was again sitting upon the stone before his cave while the animals were roving about in the world outside fetching fresh food – and fresh honey, too: for Zarathustra had consumed and squandered the old honey to the last drop.  But as he was sitting there with a stick in his hand, tracing the shadow of his figure in the ground, thinking (and truly!) not about himself and his shadow – all at once he started back in alarm: for he saw another shadow beside his own.  And as he quickly rose and looked around, behold, there stood beside him the prophet, the same that had once eaten and drunk at his table, the prophet of the great weariness who taught: ‘It is all one, nothing is worth while, the world is without meaning, knowledge chokes.’ But his face had changed in the interim; and when Zarathustra looked into the prophet’s eyes, his heart was again startled: so many evil prophecies and ashen lightning-flashes passed across this face! The prophet, who had perceived what was going on in Zarathustra’s soul, wiped his hand over his face, as if he wanted to wipe it away; Zarathustra did the same.  And when each had silently composed and reassured himself, they shook hands as a sign that they wanted to recognize one another.  ‘Welcome to you,’ said Zarathustra, ‘you prophet of the great weariness; not in vain shall you once have been guest at my table.  Eat and drink with me today also, and forgive a cheerful old man for sitting down at table with you!’ ‘A cheerful old man?’ answered the prophet, shaking his head.  ‘But whoever you are or want to be, O Zarathustra, you have little time left up here to be it – in a little time your boat shall no longer sit in the dry!’ ‘Am I then sitting in the dry?’ asked Zarathustra, laughing.  ‘The waves around your mountain rise and rise,’ answered the prophet, ‘waves of great distress and affliction: soon they will lift your boat too, and carry you away.’ Thereupon Zarathustra was silent and wondered.  ‘Do you still hear nothing?’ the prophet went on.  ‘Does not the sound of rushing and roaring arise from the depths?’ Zarathustra was again silent and listened: then he heard a long, protracted cry, which the abysses threw from one to another, for none of them wanted to retain it, so evil did it sound.  ‘You preacher of evil,’ said Zarathustra at last, ‘that is a cry of distress and a human cry, perhaps it comes from out a black sea.  But what is human distress to me! The ultimate sin that is reserved for me – perhaps you know what it is called?’ ‘Pity !’ answered the prophet from an overflowing heart, and raised both hands aloft – ‘O Zarathustra, I come to seduce you to your ultimate sin!’ – And hardly were these words spoken than the cry rang out again, and more protracted and more distressful than before, and much nearer.  ‘Do you hear? Do you hear, O Zarathustra?’ cried the prophet.  ‘The cry is meant for you, it calls to you: Come, come, come, it is time, it is high time!’ Hereupon Zarathustra was silent, confused, and deeply shaken; at last he asked like one undecided: ‘And who is it that calls me?’ ‘But you know who it is,’ answered the prophet vehemently, ‘why do you hide yourself? It is the Higher Man that cries for you!’ ‘The Higher Man?’ cried Zarathustra, horror-struck.  ‘What does he want? What does he want? The Higher Man! What does he want here?’ – and his skin was covered with sweat.  The prophet, however, did not respond to Zarathustra’s anguish, but listened intently towards the depths.  But when it had remained quiet there for a long time, he turned his gaze back and saw Zarathustra standing and trembling.  ‘O Zarathustra,’ he began in a scornful voice, ‘you do not stand there like one made giddy by happiness: you will have to dance if you are not to fall over! ‘But even if you were to dance before me and indulge in all your tricks, no one could say: “Behold, here dances the last happy man!” ‘Anyone who sought him here would visit these heights in vain: he would find caves, certainly, and backwood-caves, hiding-places for the hidden, but not mines of happiness and treasure-houses and new gold-veins of happiness.  ‘Happiness – how could man find happiness with such buried men and hermits! Must I yet seek ultimate happiness upon blissful islands and far away among forgotten seas? ‘But it is all one, nothing is worth while, seeking is useless, and there are no blissful islands any more!’ Thus sighed the prophet; with his last sigh, however, Zarathustra again became cheerful and assured, like one emerging from a deep chasm into the light.  ‘No! No! Thrice No!’ he cried vigorously, and stroked his beard.  ‘I know better! There still are blissful islands! Do not talk about such things, you sighing sack-cloth! ‘Cease to splash about such things, you morning rain-cloud! Do I not stand here already wet with your affliction and drenched as a dog? ‘Now I shall shake myself and run away from you, so that I may become dry again: you must not be surprised at that! Do you think me discourteous? But this is my court.  ‘But concerning your Higher Man: very well! I shall seek him at once in those forests: his cry came from there .  Perhaps he is being attacked by an evil beast.  ‘He is in my domain: here he shall not come to harm! And truly, there are many evil beasts about me.’ With these words Zarathustra turned to go.  Then the prophet said: ‘O Zarathustra, you are a rogue! ‘I know it: you want to be rid of me! You would rather run into the forests and waylay evil beasts! ‘But what good will it do you? In the evening you will have me back; I shall sit in your own cave, patient and heavy as a log – and wait for you!’ ‘So be it!’ Zarathustra shouted behind him as he departed: ‘and whatever in my cave belongs to me also belongs to you, my guest! ‘But should you discover honey in there, very well! just lick it up, you growling bear, and sweeten your soul! For in the evening we must both be in good spirits, ‘in good spirits and glad that this day has ended! And you yourself shall dance to my songs as my dancing bear.  ‘You do not believe it? You are shaking your head? Very well! Go on, old bear! But I too – am a prophet!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Adder’s Bite O NE day Zarathustra had fallen asleep under a fig tree because of the heat, and had laid his arms over his face.  An adder came along and bit him in the neck, so that Zarathustra cried out with pain.  When he had taken his arm from his face he regarded the snake: it recognized Zarathustra’s eyes, turned away awkwardly and was about to go.  ‘No, don’t go,’ said Zarathustra; ‘you have not yet received my thanks! You have awakened me at the right time, I still have a long way to go.’ ‘You have only a short way to go,’ said the adder sadly, ‘my poison is deadly.’ Zarathustra smiled.  ‘When did a dragon ever die from the poison of a snake?’ he said.  ‘But take your poison back! You are not rich enough to give it me!’ Then the adder fell upon his neck again and licked his wound.  When Zarathustra once told this to his disciples, they asked: ‘And what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of your story?’ Zarathustra answered the question thus: The good and just call me the destroyer of morals: my story is immoral.  When, however, you have an enemy, do not requite him good for evil: for that would make him ashamed.  But prove that he has done something good to you.  Better to be angry than make ashamed! And when you are cursed, I do not like it that you then want to bless.  Rather curse back a little! And should a great injustice be done you, then quickly do five little injustices besides.  He who bears injustice alone is terrible to behold.  Did you know this already? Shared injustice is half justice.  And he who can bear it should take the injustice upon himself.  A little revenge is more human than no revenge at all.  And if the punishment be not also a right and an honour for the transgressor, then I do not like your punishment.  It is more noble to declare yourself wrong than to maintain you are right, especially when you are right.  Only you must be rich enough for it.  I do not like your cold justice; and from the eye of your judges there always gazes only the executioner and his cold steel.  Tell me, where is the justice which is love with seeing eyes to be found? Then devise the love that bears not only all punishment but also all guilt! Then devise the justice that acquits everyone except the judges! Will you learn this, too? To him who wants to be just from the very heart even a lie becomes philanthropy.  But how could I be just from the very heart? How can I give everyone what is his? Let this suffice me: I give everyone what is mine.  Finally, my brothers, guard yourselves against doing wrong to any hermit! How could a hermit forget? How could he requite? A hermit is like a deep well.  It is easy to throw a stone into it; but if it sink to the bottom, tell me, who shall fetch it out again? Guard yourselves against offending the hermit! But if you have done so, well then, kill him as well! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Redemption As Zarathustra was going across the great bridge one day, the cripples and beggars surrounded him and a hunchback spoke to him thus: Behold, Zarathustra! The people, too, learn from you and acquire belief in your teaching: but for the people to believe you completely, one thing is still needed – you must first convince even us cripples! Here now you have a fine selection and truly, an opportunity with more than one forelock! You can cure the blind and make the lame walk; and from him who has too much behind him you could well take a little away, too – that, I think, would be the right way to make the cripples believe in Zarathustra! But Zarathustra replied thus to him who had spoken: If one takes the hump away from the hunchback, one takes away his spirit – that is what the people teach.  And if one gives eyes to the blind man, he sees too many bad things on earth: so that he curses him who cured him.  But he who makes the lame man walk does him the greatest harm: for no sooner can he walk than his vices run away with him – that is what the people teach about cripples.  And why should Zarathustra not learn from the people, if the people learn from Zarathustra? But it is the least serious thing to me, since I have been among men, to see that this one lacks an eye and that one an ear and a third lacks a leg, and there are others who have lost their tongue or their nose or their head.  I see and have seen worse things and many of them so monstrous that I should not wish to speak of all of them; but of some of them I should not wish to be silent: and they are, men who lack everything except one thing, of which they have too much – men who are no more than a great eye or a great mouth or a great belly or something else great – I call such men inverse cripples.  And when I emerged from my solitude and crossed over this bridge for the first time, I did not believe my eyes and looked and looked again and said at last: ‘That is an ear! An ear as big as a man!’ I looked yet more closely: and in fact under the ear there moved something that was pitifully small and meagre and slender.  And in truth, the monstrous ear sat upon a little, thin stalk – the stalk, however, was a man! By the use of a magnifying glass one could even discern a little, envious face as well; and one could discern, too, that a turgid little soul was dangling from the stalk.  The people told me, however, that the great ear was not merely a man, but a great man, a genius.  But I have never believed the people when they talked about great men – and I held to my belief that it was an inverse cripple, who had too little of everything and too much of one thing.  When Zarathustra had spoken thus to the hunchback and to those whose mouthpiece and advocate he was, he turned to his disciples with profound ill-humour and said: Truly, my friends, I walk among men as among the fragments and limbs of men! The terrible thing to my eye is to find men shattered in pieces and scattered as if over a battle-field of slaughter.  And when my eye flees from the present to the past, it always discovers the same thing: fragments and limbs and dreadful chances – but no men! The present and the past upon the earth – alas! my friends – that is my most intolerable burden; and I should not know how to live, if I were not a seer of that which must come.  A seer, a wilier, a creator, a future itself and a bridge to the future – and alas, also like a cripple upon this bridge: Zarathustra is all this.  And even you have often asked yourselves: Who is Zarathustra to us? What shall we call him? and, like me, you answer your own questions with questions.  Is he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an inheritor? A harvest? Or a ploughshare? A physician? Or a convalescent? Is he a poet? Or a genuine man? A liberator? Or a subduer? A good man? Or an evil man? I walk among men as among fragments of the future: of that future which I scan.  And it is all my art and aim, to compose into one and bring together what is fragment and riddle and dreadful chance.  And how could I endure to be a man, if man were not also poet and reader of riddles and the redeemer of chance! To redeem the past and to transform every ‘It was’ into an ‘I wanted it thus!’ – that alone do I call redemption! Will – that is what the liberator and bringer of joy is called: thus I have taught you, my friends! But now learn this as well: The will itself is still a prisoner.  Willing liberates: but what is it that fastens in fetters even the liberator? ‘It was’: that is what the will’s teeth-gnashing and most lonely affliction is called.  Powerless against that which has been done, the will is an angry spectator of all things past.  The will cannot will backwards; that it cannot break time and time’s desire – that is the will’s most lonely affliction.  Willing liberates: what does willing itself devise to free itself from its affliction and to mock at its dungeon? Alas, every prisoner becomes a fool! The imprisoned will, too, releases itself in a foolish way.  It is sullenly wrathful that time does not run back; ‘That which was’ – that is what the stone which it cannot roll away is called.  And so, out of wrath and ill-temper, the will rolls stones about and takes revenge upon him who does not, like it, feel wrath and ill-temper.  Thus the will, the liberator, becomes a malefactor: and upon all that can suffer it takes revenge for its inability to go backwards.  This, yes, this alone is revenge itself: the will’s antipathy towards time and time’s ‘It was’.  Truly, a great foolishness dwells in our will; and that this foolishness acquired spirit has become a curse to all human kind.  The spirit of revenge : my friends, that, up to now, has been mankind’s chief concern; and where there was suffering, there was always supposed to be punishment.  ‘Punishment’ is what revenge calls itself: it feigns a good conscience for itself with a lie.  And because there is suffering in the wilier himself, since he cannot will backwards – therefore willing itself and all life was supposed to be – punishment! And then cloud upon cloud rolled over the spirit: until at last madness preached: ‘Everything passes away, therefore everything deserves to pass away! ‘And that law of time, that time must devour her children, is justice itself: thus madness preached.  ‘Things are ordered morally according to justice and punishment.  Oh, where is redemption from the stream of things and from the punishment “existence”?’ Thus madness preached.  ‘Can there be redemption when there is eternal justice? Alas, the stone “It was” cannot be rolled away: all punishments, too, must be eternal!’ Thus madness preached.  ‘No deed can be annihilated: how could a deed be undone through punishment? That existence too must be an eternally-recurring deed and guilt, this, this is what is eternal in the punishment “existence”! ‘Except the will at last redeem itself and willing become not-willing –’: but you, my brothers, know this fable-song of madness! I led you away from these fable-songs when I taught you: ‘The will is a creator.’ All ‘It was’ is a fragment, a riddle, a dreadful chance – until the creative will says to it: ‘But I willed it thus!’ Until the creative will says to it: ‘But I will it thus! Thus shall I will it!’ But has it ever spoken thus? And when will this take place? Has the will yet been unharnessed from its own folly? Has the will become its own redeemer and bringer of joy? Has it unlearned the spirit of revenge and all teeth-gnashing? And who has taught it to be reconciled with time, and higher things than reconciliation? The will that is the will to power must will something higher than any reconciliation – but how shall that happen? Who has taught it to will backwards, too? But at this point of his discourse, Zarathustra suddenly broke off and looked exactly like a man seized by extremest terror.  With terrified eyes he gazed upon his disciples; his eyes transpierced their thoughts and their reservations 22 as if with arrows.  But after a short time he laughed again and said in a soothed voice: ‘It is difficult to live among men because keeping silent is so difficult.  Especially for a babbler.’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  The hunchback, however, had listened to the conversation and had covered his face the while; but when he heard Zarathustra laugh, he looked up in curiosity, and said slowly: ‘But why does Zarathustra speak to us differently than to his disciples?’ Zarathustra answered: ‘What is surprising in that? One may well speak in a hunchbacked manner to a hunchback!’ 23 ‘Very good,’ said the hunchback; ‘and with pupils one may well tell tales out of school.  ‘But why does Zarathustra speak to his pupils differently – than to himself?’ Thus Spoke Zarathustra FURTHER READING David B.

Then the world seemed to me the dream and fiction of a God; coloured vapour before the eyes of a discontented God.  Good and evil and joy and sorrow and I and You – I thought them coloured vapour before the creator’s eyes.  The creator wanted to look away from himself, so he created the world.  It is intoxicating joy for the sufferer to look away from his suffering and to forget himself.  Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting – that is what I once thought the world.  This world, the eternally imperfect, the eternal and imperfect image of a contradiction – an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator – that is what I once thought the world.  Thus I too once cast my deluded fancy beyond mankind, like all afterworldsmen.  Beyond mankind in reality? Ah, brothers, this God which I created was human work and human madness, like all gods! He was human, and only a poor piece of man and Ego: this phantom came to me from my own fire and ashes, that is the truth! It did not come to me from the ‘beyond’! What happened, my brothers? I, the sufferer, overcame myself, I carried my own ashes to the mountains, I made for myself a brighter flame.  And behold! the phantom fled from me! Now to me, the convalescent, it would be suffering and torment to believe in such phantoms: it would be suffering to me now and humiliation.  Thus I speak to the afterworldsmen.  It was suffering and impotence – that created all afterworlds; and that brief madness of happiness that only the greatest sufferer experiences.  Weariness, which wants to reach the ultimate with a single leap, with a death-leap, 6 a poor ignorant weariness, which no longer wants even to want: that created all gods and afterworlds.  Believe me, my brothers! It was the body that despaired of the body – that touched the ultimate walls with the fingers of its deluded spirit.  Believe me, my brothers! It was the body that despaired of the earth – that heard the belly of being speak to it.  And then it wanted to get its head through the ultimate walls – and not its head only 7 – over into the ‘other world’.  But that ‘other world’, that inhuman, dehumanized world which is a heavenly Nothing, is well hidden from men; and the belly of being does not speak to man, except as man.  Truly, all being is hard to demonstrate; it is hard to make it speak.  Yet, tell me, brothers, is not the most wonderful of all things most clearly demonstrated? Yes, this Ego, with its contradiction and confusion, speaks most honestly of its being – this creating, willing, evaluating Ego, which is the measure and value of things.  And this most honest being, the Ego – it speaks of the body, and it insists upon the body, even when it fables and fabricates and flutters with broken wings.  Ever more honestly it learns to speak, the Ego: and the more it learns, the more it finds titles and honours for the body and the earth.  My Ego taught me a new pride, I teach it to men: No longer to bury the head in the sand of heavenly things, but to carry it freely, an earthly head which creates meaning for the earth.  I teach mankind a new will: to desire this path that men have followed blindly, and to call it good and no more to creep aside from it, like the sick and dying! It was the sick and dying who despised the body and the earth and invented the things of heaven and the redeeming drops of blood: but even these sweet and dismal poisons they took from the body and the earth! They wanted to escape from their misery and the stars were too far for them.  Then they sighed: ‘Oh if only there were heavenly paths by which to creep into another existence and into happiness!’ – then they contrived for themselves their secret ways and their draughts of blood! Now they thought themselves transported from their bodies and from this earth, these ingrates.  Yet to what do they owe the convulsion and joy of their transport? To their bodies and to this earth.  Zarathustra is gentle with the sick.  Truly, he is not angry at their manner of consolation and ingratitude.  May they become convalescents and overcomers and make for themselves a higher body! Neither is Zarathustra angry with the convalescent if he glances tenderly at his illusions and creeps at midnight around the grave of his God: but even his tears still speak to me of sickness and a sick body.  There have always been many sickly people among those who invent fables and long for God: they have a raging hate for the enlightened man and for that youngest of virtues which is called honesty.  They are always looking back to dark ages: then, indeed, illusion and faith were a different question; raving of the reason was likeness to God, and doubt was sin.  I know these Godlike people all too well: they want to be believed in, and doubt to be sin.  I also know all too well what it is they themselves most firmly believe in.  Truly not in afterworlds and redeeming drops of blood: they believe most firmly in the body, and their own body is for them their thing-in-itself.  But it is a sickly thing to them: and they would dearly like to get out of their skins.  That is why they hearken to preachers of death and themselves preach afterworlds.  Listen rather, my brothers, to the voice of the healthy body: this is a purer voice and a more honest one.  Purer and more honest of speech is the healthy body, perfect and square-built: and it speaks of the meaning of the earth.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Scholars A S I lay asleep, a sheep ate at the ivy-wreath upon my head – ate and said: ‘Zarathustra is no longer a scholar.’ It spoke and went away stiffly and proud.  A child told me of it.  I like to lie here where children play, beside the broken wall, among thistles and red poppies.  To children I am still a scholar, and to thistles and red poppies, too.  They are innocent, even in their wickedness.  But to the sheep I am no longer a scholar: thus my fate will have it – blessed be my fate! For this is the truth: I have left the house of scholars and slammed the door behind me.  Too long did my soul sit hungry at their table; I have not been schooled, as they have, to crack knowledge as one cracks nuts.  I love freedom and the air over fresh soil; I would sleep on ox-skins rather than on their dignities and respectabilities.  I am too hot and scorched by my own thought: it is often about to take my breath away.  Then I have to get into the open air and away from all dusty rooms.  But they sit cool in the cool shade: they want to be mere spectators in everything and they take care not to sit where the sun burns upon the steps.  Like those who stand in the street and stare at the people passing by, so they too wait and stare at thoughts that others have thought.  If one takes hold of them, they involuntarily raise a dust like sacks of flour; but who could guess that their dust derived from corn and from the golden joy of summer fields? When they give themselves out as wise, their little sayings and truths make me shiver: their wisdom often smells as if it came from the swamp: and indeed, I have heard the frog croak in it! They are clever, they have cunning fingers: what is my simplicity compared with their diversity? Their fingers understand all threading and knitting and weaving: thus they weave the stockings of the spirit! They are excellent clocks: only be careful to wind them up properly! Then they tell the hour without error and make a modest noise in doing so.  They work like mills and rammers: just throw seed-corn into them! – they know how to grind corn small and make white dust of it.  They keep a sharp eye upon one another and do not trust one another as well as they might.  Inventive in small slynesses, they lie in wait for those whose wills go upon lame feet – they lie in wait like spiders.  I have seen how carefully they prepare their poisons; they always put on protective gloves.  They also know how to play with loaded dice; and I found them playing so zealously that they were sweating.  We are strangers to one another, and their virtues are even more opposed to my taste than are their falsehoods and loaded dice.  And when I lived among them I lived above them.  They grew angry with me for that.  They did not want to know that someone was walking over their heads; and so they put wood and dirt and rubbish between their heads and me.  Thus they muffled the sound of my steps: and from then on the most scholarly heard me the worst.  They put all the faults and weaknesses of mankind between themselves and me – they call this a ‘false flooring’ in their houses.  But I walk above their heads with my thoughts in spite of that; and even if I should walk upon my own faults, I should still be above them and their heads.  For men ate not equal: thus speaks justice.  And what I desire they may not desire! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Awakening 1 A FTER the song of the wanderer and shadow, the cave suddenly became full of noise and laughter: and as the assembled guests were all speaking together and even the ass no longer remained silent in the face of such encouragement, Zarathustra was overcome by a little repugnance and scorn towards his visitors: although, at the same time, he rejoiced at their gaiety.  For it seemed to him to be a sign of recovery.  So he stole out into the open air and spoke with his animals.  ‘Where is their distress now?’ he said, and already he was breathing again after his little disgust, ‘it seems that in my home they have unlearned distressful crying! ‘although, unhappily, not yet crying itself.’ And Zarathustra stopped his ears, for just then the ‘Ye-a’ of the ass mingled strangely with the loud rejoicing of these Higher Men.  ‘They are merry,’ he began again,’ and, who knows, perhaps at the expense of their host.  And if they have learned laughing from me, still it is not my laughter they have learned.  ‘But what of it! They are old men: they recover in their own way, they laugh in their own way; my ears have suffered worse things and not been annoyed.  ‘This day is a victory: it wavers already, it flees, the Spirit of Gravity , my old arch-enemy I How well this day is ending, that began so ill and so gravely! ‘And it is ending.  Evening has already come: it is riding over the sea to us; that excellent horseman! How it sways, joyfully returning, in its purple saddle! ‘The sky gazes, clear, upon it, the world lies deep: O all you strange men who have come to me, it is already worth while to live with me! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  And then the shouting and laughter of the Higher Men again came from the cave: it had started again.  ‘They are biting, my bait is effective, before them too their enemy, the Spirit of Gravity, is wavering.  Already they are learning to laugh at themselves: do I hear aright? ‘My man’s fare, my succulent and strengthening discourse, is effective: and truly, I did not feed them with distending vegetables! But with warriors’ food, with conquerors’ food: I awakened new desires.  ‘There are new hopes in their arms and legs, their hearts are stretching themselves.  They are discovering new words, soon their spirits will breathe wantonness.  ‘To be sure, such food may not be for children, or for fond little women, old or young.  Their stomachs are persuaded otherwise; I am not their teacher and physician.  ‘These Higher Men’s disgust is wavering: very well! that is my victory.  They are growing assured in my kingdom, all stupid shame is leaving them, they are unburdening themselves.  ‘They are unburdening their hearts, good hours are coming back to them, they take their ease and ruminate – they grow thankful .  ‘This I take for the best sign: they grow thankful.  Before long they will be devising festivals and erecting memorials to their old joys.  ‘They are convalescents !’ Thus spoke Zarathustra gaily to his heart and gazed out; his animals, however, pressed around him and respected his happiness and his silence.  2 But suddenly Zarathustra’s ear was startled: for the cave, which had been full of noise and laughter, all at once became deathly still; his nose, however, smelt a sweet-smelling vapour and incense, as if of burning pine-cones.  ‘What is happening? What are they doing?’ he asked himself, and stole to the entrance, so that he might behold his guests unobserved.  But, wonder upon wonders! what did he then see with his own eyes! ‘They have all become pious again, they are praying , they are mad!’ he said, and was astounded beyond measure.  And indeed, all these Higher Men, the two kings, the retired pope, the evil sorcerer, the voluntary beggar, the wanderer and shadow, the old prophet, the conscientious man of the spirit, and the ugliest man: they were all kneeling like children and credulous old women, and worshipping the ass.  And at that very moment the ugliest man began to gurgle and snort, as if something unutterable was trying to get out of him; but when he actually reached the point of speech, behold, it was a strange, pious litany in praise of the worshipped and perfumed ass.  The litany went thus: Amen! And praise and honour and wisdom and thanks and glory and strength be to our God for ever and ever! The ass, however, brayed ‘Ye-a’.  He bears our burden, he has taken upon himself the likeness of a slave, he is patient from the heart and he never says Nay; and he who loves his God, chastises him.  The ass, however, brayed ‘Ye-a’.  He does not speak, except always to say Yea to the world he created: thus he praises his world.  It is his subtlety that does not speak: thus he is seldom thought wrong.  The ass, however, brayed ‘Ye-a’.  He goes through the world unpretentiously.  Grey is the favourite colour 53 in which he wraps his virtue.  If he has spirit, he conceals it; but everyone believes in his long ears.  The ass, however, brayed ‘Ye-a’.  What hidden wisdom it is, that he wears long ears and says only Yea and never Nay! Has he not created the world after his own image, that is, as stupid as possible? The ass, however, brayed ‘Ye-a’.  You go straight and crooked ways; you care little what we men think straight or crooked.  Your kingdom is beyond good and evil.  It is your innocence not to know what innocence is.  The ass, however, brayed ‘Ye-a’.  For behold, how you spurn no one, not beggars nor kings.  You suffer little children to come to you, and when bad boys bait you, you simply say Yea.  The ass, however, brayed ‘Ye-a’.  You love she-asses and fresh figs, you eat anything.  A thistle titillates your heart, if you happen to be hungry.  The wisdom of a god is in that.  The ass, however, brayed ‘Ye-a’.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Flies of the Market-place F LEE, my friend, into your solitude! I see you deafened by the uproar of the great men and pricked by the stings of the small ones.  Forest and rock know well how to be silent with you.  Be like the tree again, the wide-branching tree that you love: calmly and attentively it leans out over the sea.  Where solitude ceases, there the market-place begins; and where the market-place begins, there begins the uproar of the great actors and the buzzing of the poisonous flies.  In the world even the best things are worthless apart from him who first presents them: people call these presenters ‘great men’.  The people have little idea of greatness, that is to say: creativeness.  But they have a taste for all presenters and actors of great things.  The world revolves about the inventor of new values: imperceptibly it revolves.  But the people and the glory revolve around the actor: that is ‘the way of the world’.  The actor possesses spirit but little conscience of the spirit.  8 He always believes in that with which he most powerfully produces belief – produces belief in himself ! Tomorrow he will have a new faith and the day after tomorrow a newer one.  He has a quick perception, as the people have, and a capricious temperament.  To overthrow – to him that means: to prove.  To drive frantic – to him that means: to convince.  And blood is to him the best of all arguments.  A truth that penetrates only sensitive ears he calls a lie and a thing of nothing.  Truly, he believes only in gods who make a great noise in the world! The market-place is full of solemn buffoons – and the people boast of their great men! These are their heroes of the hour.  But the hour presses them: so they press you.  And from you too they require a Yes or a No.  And woe to you if you want to set your chair between For and Against.  Do not be jealous, lover of truth, because of these inflexible and oppressive men! Truth has never yet clung to the arm of an inflexible man.  Return to your security because of these abrupt men: only in the market-place is one assailed with Yes? or No? The experience of all deep wells is slow: they must wait long until they know what has fallen into their depths.  All great things occur away from glory and the marketplace: the inventors of new values have always lived away from glory and the market-place.  Flee, my friend, into your solitude: I see you stung by poisonous flies.  Flee to where the raw, rough breeze blows! Flee into your solitude! You have lived too near the small and the pitiable men.  Flee from their hidden vengeance! Towards you they are nothing but vengeance.  No longer lift your arm against them! They are innumerable and it is not your fate to be a fly-swat.  Innumerable are these small and pitiable men; and raindrops and weeds have already brought about the destruction of many a proud building.  You are no stone, but already these many drops have made you hollow.  You will yet break and burst apart through these many drops.  I see you wearied by poisonous flies, I see you bloodily torn in a hundred places; and your pride refuses even to be angry.  They want blood from you in all innocence, their bloodless souls thirst for blood – and therefore they sting in all innocence.  But you, profound man, you suffer too profoundly even from small wounds; and before you have recovered, the same poison-worm is again crawling over your hand.  You are too proud to kill these sweet-toothed creatures.  But take care that it does not become your fate to bear all their poisonous injustice! They buzz around you even with their praise: and their praise is importunity.  They want to be near your skin and your blood.  They flatter you as if you were a god or a devil; they whine before you as before a god or a devil.  What of it! They are flatterers and whiners, and nothing more.  And they are often kind to you.  But that has always been the prudence of the cowardly.  Yes, the cowardly are prudent! They think about you a great deal with their narrow souls -you are always suspicious to them.  Everything that is thought about a great deal is finally thought suspicious.  9 They punish you for all your virtues.  Fundamentally they forgive you only – your mistakes.  Because you are gentle and just-minded, you say: ‘They are not to be blamed for their little existence.’ But their little souls think: ‘All great existence is blameworthy.’ Even when you are gentle towards them, they still feel you despise them; and they return your kindness with secret unkindness.  Your silent pride always offends their taste; they rejoice if you are ever modest enough to be vain.  When we recognize a peculiarity in a man we also inflame that peculiarity.  So guard yourself against the small men! Before you, they feel themselves small, and their baseness glimmers and glows against you in hidden vengeance.  Have you not noticed how often they became silent when you approached them, and how their strength left them like smoke from a dying fire? Yes, my friend, you are a bad conscience to your neighbours: for they are unworthy of you.  Thus they hate you and would dearly like to suck your blood.  Your neighbours will always be poisonous flies: that about you which is great, that itself must make them more poisonous and ever more fly-like.  Flee, my friend, into your solitude and to where the raw, rough breeze blows! It is not your fate to be a fly-swat.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Shadow B UT hardly had the voluntary beggar run off and was Zarathustra alone again than he heard a new voice behind him calling: ‘Stop! Zarathustra! Wait! It is I, O Zarathustra, I, your shadow!’ But Zarathustra did not wait, for a sudden ill-humour overcame him on account of all the crowding and thronging on his mountains.  ‘Where has my solitude fled?’ he said.  ‘Truly, it is becoming too much for me; these mountains are swarming, my kingdom is no longer of this world, I need new mountains.  ‘Does my shadow call me? Of what account is my shadow I Let it run after me! I – shall run away from it.’ Thus spoke Zarathustra to his heart and ran off.  But he who was behind him followed after: so that forthwith there were three runners one behind the other, that is, foremost the voluntary beggar, then Zarathustra, and thirdly and hindmost his shadow.  They had not been running thus for long when Zarathustra became conscious of his folly and at once shook off his ill-humour and disgust.  ‘What!’ he said, ‘have not the most laughable things always happened with us old hermits and saints? ‘Truly, my folly has grown high in the mountains! Now I hear six foolish old legs clattering one behind the other! ‘But can Zarathustra really be afraid of a shadow? And anyway, I think it has longer legs than I.’ Thus spoke Zarathustra, laughing with his eyes and his entrails, then stopped and turned quickly around – and behold, in doing so he almost threw his follower and shadow to the ground, the latter followed so closely upon his heels and was so weak.  For when Zarathustra inspected him with his eyes, he was as terrified as if he had suddenly seen a ghost, so slight, dark, hollow, and spent did this follower appear.  ‘Who are you?’ Zarathustra asked furiously, ‘what are you doing here? And why do you call yourself my shadow? I do not like you.’ ‘Forgive me,’ answered the shadow, ‘that it is I; and if you do not like me, very good, O Zarathustra! I praise you and your good taste in that.  ‘I am a wanderer, who has already walked far at your heels: always going but without a goal and without a home: so that, truly, I am almost the eternal Wandering Jew, except that I am neither eternal nor a Jew.  ‘What? Must I always be going? Whirled by every wind, restless, driven onward? O Earth, you have grown too round for me! ‘I have sat on every surface, like weary dust I have fallen asleep upon mirrors and window-panes: everything takes from me, nothing gives, I have become thin – I am almost like a shadow.  ‘But I have fled to you and followed you longest, O Zarathustra, and although I have hidden myself from you, yet I was your best shadow: where you have sat there I sat too.  ‘1 have travelled with you in the remotest, coldest worlds, like a ghost that voluntarily walks over snow and winter roofs.  ‘I have striven with you into all that was forbidden, worst, most remote: and if anything in me be a virtue, it is that I have feared no prohibition.  ‘I have broken up with you whatever my heart revered.  I have overthrown boundary stones and statues, I have pursued the most dangerous desires – truly, I once went beyond every crime.  ‘I have unlearned with you belief in words and values and great names.  When the Devil casts his skin does his name not also fall away? For that too is a skin.  The Devil himself is perhaps – a skin.  ‘“Nothing is true, everything is permitted”: thus I told myself.  I plunged into the coldest water, with head and heart.  Alas, how often I stood naked, like a red crab, on that account! ‘Alas, where have all my goodness and shame and belief in the good fled! Alas, where is that mendacious innocence that I once possessed, the innocence of the good and their noble lies! ‘Truly, too often did I follow close by the feet of truth: then it kicked me in the face.  Sometimes I intended to lie, and behold! only then did I hit – the truth.  ‘Too much has become clear to me: now I am no longer concerned with it.  No longer is there anything living that I love – how should I still love myself? ‘“To live as I desire to live or not to live at all”: that is what I want, that is what the most saintly man wants.  But alas! how can I still have – a desire? ‘Have I – still a goal? A haven to which my sail races? ‘A good wind? Alas, only he who knows where he is going knows which wind is a good and fair wind for him.  ‘What is left to me? A heart weary and insolent; a restless will; infirm wings; a broken backbone.  ‘This seeking for my home: O Zarathustra, do you know this seeking was my affliction, 46 it is consuming me.  ‘Where is – my home? I ask and seek and have sought for it, I have not found it.  Oh eternal Everywhere, oh eternal Nowhere, oh eternal – Vanity!’ Thus spoke the shadow, and Zarathustra’s face lengthened at his words.  ‘You are my shadow!’ he said at length, sorrowfully.  ‘Your danger is no small one, you free spirit and wanderer! You have had a bad day: see you do not have a worse evening! ‘Even a prison at last seems bliss to such restless people as you.  Have you ever seen how captured criminals sleep? They sleep peacefully, they enjoy their new security.  ‘Take care that you are not at last captured by a narrow belief, a hard, stern illusion! For henceforth everything that is narrow and firm will entice and tempt you.  ‘You have lost your goal: alas, how will you get over and laugh away that loss? By losing your goal – you have lost your way, too! ‘You poor traveller, wanderer, you weary butterfly! Would you this evening have a resting place and homestead? So go up to my cave! ‘Yonder leads the way to my cave.  And now I will run quickly away from you again.  Already it is as if a shadow were lying upon me.  ‘I will run alone, so that it may again grow bright around me.  For that I still have to be a long time merrily on my legs.  In the evening, however, we shall – dance!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Home-Coming O SOLITUDE ! Solitude, my home ! I have lived too long wildly in wild strange lands to come home to you without tears! Now shake your finger at me as mothers do, now smile at me as mothers smile, now say merely: ‘And who was it that once stormed away from me like a storm-wind? – ‘who departing cried: I have sat too long with Solitude, I have unlearned how to be silent! You have surely learned that – now? ‘O Zarathustra, I know all: and that you were lonelier among the crowd, you solitary, than you ever were with me! ‘Loneliness is one thing, solitude another: you have learned that – now! And that among men you will always be wild and strange: ‘wild and strange even when they love you: for above all they want to be indulged ! ‘But here you are at your own hearth and home; here you can utter everything and pour out every reason, nothing is here ashamed of hidden, hardened feelings.  ‘Here all things come caressingly to your discourse and flatter you: for they want to ride upon your back.  Upon every image you here ride to every truth.  ‘Here you may speak to all things straight and true: and truly, it sounds as praise to their ears, that someone should speak with all things – honestly! ‘But it is another thing to be lonely.  For, do you remember, O Zarathustra? When once your bird cried above you as you stood in the forest undecided, ignorant where to go, beside a corpse.  ‘When you said: May my animals lead me! I found it more dangerous among men than among animals.  That was loneliness! ‘And do you remember, O Zarathustra? When you sat upon your island, a well of wine among empty buckets, giving and distributing, bestowing and out-pouring among the thirsty: ‘until at last you sat alone thirsty among the intoxicated and lamented each night: “Is it not more blessed to receive than to give? And more blessed to steal than to receive?” – That was loneliness! ‘And do you remember, O Zarathustra? When your stillest hour came and tore you forth from yourself, when it said in an evil whisper: “Speak and break!” – ‘when it made you repent of all your waiting and silence and discouraged your humble courage: That was loneliness!’ O Solitude! Solitude, my home I How blissfully and tenderly does your voice speak to me! We do not question one another, we do not complain to one another, we go openly together through open doors.  For with you all is open and clear; and here even the hours run on lighter feet.  For time weighs down more heavily in the dark than in the light.  Here, the words and word-chests of all existence spring open to me: all existence here wants to become words, all becoming here wants to learn speech from me.  Down there, however – all speech is in vain! There, the best wisdom is to forget and pass by: I have learned that – now! He who wants to understand all things among men has to touch all things.  But my hands are too clean for that.  I even dislike to breathe in their breath; alas, that I lived so long among their noise and bad breath! O blissful stillness around me! O pure odours around me! Oh, how this stillness draws pure breath from a deep breast! Oh, how it listens, this blissful stillness! But down there – everything speaks, everything is unheard.  One may ring in one’s wisdom with bells – the shopkeeper in the market-place will out-ring it with pennies! Everything among them speaks, no one knows any longer how to understand.  Everything falls away into failure, nothing falls any longer into deep wells.  Everything among them speaks, nothing prospers and comes to an end any longer.  Everything cackles, but who still wants to sit quietly upon the nest and hatch eggs? Everything among them speaks, everything is talked down.  And what yesterday was still too hard for time itself and its teeth, today hangs chewed and picked from the mouth of the men of today.  Everything among them speaks, everything is betrayed.  And what was once called a secret and a secrecy of profound souls, today belongs to the street-trumpeters and other butterflies.  O humankind, you strange thing! You noise in dark streets! Now again you lie behind me – my greatest danger lies behind me! My greatest danger always lay in indulgence and sufferance; and all humankind wants to be indulged and suffered.  With truths held back, with foolish hand and foolish-fond heart and rich in pity’s little lies – that is how I used to live among men.  I sat among them disguised, ready to misunderstand myself so that I might endure them , and glad to tell myself: ‘You fool, you do not know men!’ One forgets what one has learned about men when one lives among men: there is too much foreground in all men – what can far-seeing, far-seeking eyes do there ! And when they misunderstood me, I, like a fool, indulged them more than I did myself: for I was accustomed to being hard with myself and often even taking revenge on myself for this indulgence.  Stung by poisonous dies and hollowed out like a stone by many drops of wickedness: that is how I sat among them and still told myself: ‘Everything small is innocent of its smallness!’ Especially those who call themselves ‘the good’ did I discover to be the most poisonous flies: they sting in all innocence; how could they be – just towards me! Pity teaches him to lie who lives among the good.  Pity makes the air stifling for all free souls.  For the stupidity of the good is unfathomable.  To conceal myself and my riches – that did I learn down there: for I found everybody still poor in spirit.  It was my pity’s lie that I knew with everybody, that I saw and scented in everybody what was sufficient spirit for him and what was too much spirit for him! Their pedantic wise men: I called them wise, not pedantic – thus I learned to slur words.  Their gravediggers: I called them investigators and scholars – thus I learned to confound words.  Gravediggers dig diseases for themselves.  Evil vapours repose beneath old rubble.  One should not stir up the bog.  One should live upon mountains.  With happy nostrils I breathe again mountain-freedom! At last my nose is delivered from the odour of all humankind! My soul, tickled by sharp breezes as with sparkling wine, sneezes – sneezes and cries to itself: Bless you! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Rabble L IFE is a fountain of delight; but where the rabble also drinks all wells are poisoned.  I love all that is clean; but I do not like to see the grinning mouths and the thirst of the unclean.  They cast their eyes down into the well: now their repulsive smile glitters up to me out of the well.  They have poisoned the holy water with their lascivious-ness; and when they called their dirty dreams ‘delight’ they poisoned even the words, too.  The flame is unwilling to burn when they put their damp hearts to the fire; the spirit itself bubbles and smokes when the rabble approaches the fire.  The fruit grows mawkish and over-ripe in their hands: the fruit tree becomes unstable and withered at the top under their glance.  And many a one who turned away from life, turned away only from the rabble: he did not wish to share the well and the flame and the fruit with the rabble.  And many a one who went into the desert and suffered thirst with beasts of prey merely did not wish to sit around the cistern with dirty camel-drivers.  And many a one who came along like a destroyer and a shower of hail to all orchards wanted merely to put his foot into the jaws of the rabble and so stop its throat.  And to know that life itself has need of enmity and dying and martyrdoms, that was not the mouthful that choked me most.  But I once asked, and my question almost stifled me: What, does life have need of the rabble, too? Are poisoned wells necessary, and stinking fires and dirty dreams and maggots in the bread of life? Not my hate but my disgust hungrily devoured my life! Alas, I often grew weary of the spirit when I found the rabble, too, had been gifted with spirit! And I turned my back upon the rulers when I saw what they now call ruling: bartering and haggling for power – with the rabble! I dwelt with stopped ears among peoples with a strange language: that the language of their bartering and their haggling for power might remain strange to me.  And I went ill-humouredly through all yesterdays and todays holding my nose: truly, all yesterdays and todays smell badly of the scribbling rabble! Like a cripple who has gone blind, deaf, and dumb: thus have I lived for a long time, that I might not live with the power-rabble, the scribbling-rabble, and the pleasure-rabble.  My spirit mounted steps wearily and warily; alms of delight were its refreshment; the blind man’s life crept along on a staff.  Yet what happened to me? How did I free myself from disgust? Who rejuvenated my eyes? How did I fly to the height where the rabble no longer sit at the well? Did my disgust itself create wings and water-divining powers for me? Truly, I had to fly to the extremest height to find again the fountain of delight! Oh, I have found it, my brothers! Here, in the extremest height, the fountain of delight gushes up for me! And here there is a life at which no rabble drinks with me! You gush up almost too impetuously, fountain of delight! And in wanting to fill the cup, you often empty it again! And I still have to learn to approach you more discreetly: my heart still flows towards you all-too-impetuously.  My heart, upon which my summer burns, a short, hot, melancholy, over-joyful summer: how my summer-heart longs for your coolness! Gone is the lingering affliction of my spring! Gone the malice of my snowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, and summer-noonday! A summer at the extremest height with cold fountains and blissful stillness: oh come, my friends, that the stillness may become more blissful yet! For this is our height and our home: we live too nobly and boldly 16 here for all unclean men and their thirsts.  Only cast your pure eyes into the well of my delight, friends! You will not dim its sparkle! It shall laugh back at you with its purity.  We build our nest in the tree Future; eagles shall bring food to us solitaries in their beaks! Truly, food in which no unclean men could join us! They would think they were eating fire and burn their mouths! Truly, we do not prepare a home here for unclean men! Their bodies and their spirits would call our happiness a cave of ice! So let us live above them like strong winds, neighbours of the eagles, neighbours of the snow, neighbours of the sun: that is how strong winds live.  And like a wind will I one day blow among them and with my spirit take away the breath from their spirit: thus my future will have it.  Truly, Zarathustra is a strong wind to all flatlands; and he offers this advice to his enemies and to all that spews and spits: ‘Take care not to spit against the wind!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Song of Melancholy 1 Z ARATHUSTRA was standing near the door of his cave as he spoke this discourse; with the final words, however, he escaped from his guests and fled for a short while into the open air.  ‘Oh pure odours around me,’ he exclaimed, ‘oh blissful stillness around me! But where are my animals? Come here, come here, my eagle and my serpent! ‘Tell me, my animals: all these Higher Men – do they perhaps not smell well? Oh pure odours around me! Only now do I know and feel how I love you, my animals.’ And Zarathustra said again: ‘I love you, my animals!’ But the eagle and the serpent pressed around him when he said these words, and looked up at him.  All three stood silently together in this attitude, and sniffed and breathed in the good air together.  For the air here outside was better than with the Higher Men.  2 Hardly had Zarathustra left his cave, however, when the old sorcerer got up, looked cunningly around, and said: He has gone out! And already, you Higher Men – if I may tickle you with this name of praise and flattery, as he does – already my evil spirit of deceit and sorcery attacks me, my melancholy devil, who is an adversary of this Zarathustra from the very heart: forgive him for it! Now he insists on working charms before you, now he has his hour; I wrestle in vain with this evil spirit.  To all of you, whatever honours you may bestow upon yourselves with words, whether you call yourselves ‘the free spirits’ or ‘the truthful’ or ‘the penitents of the spirit’ or ‘the unfettered’ or ‘the great desirers’, to all of you, like me, suffer from the great disgust , for whom the old God has died and as yet no new God lies in cradles and swaddling clothes – to all of you is my evil spirit and sorcery-devil well-disposed.  I know you, Higher Men, I know him – I also know this demon whom I love despite myself, this Zarathustra: he himself often seems to me like the beautiful mask of a saint, like a strange, new masquerade in which my evil spirit, the melancholy devil, takes pleasure – I love Zarathustra, so I often think, for the sake of my evil spirit.  But already he is attacking me and compelling me, this spirit of melancholy, this evening-twilight devil: and truly, you Higher Men, he has a desire – just open your eyes! – he has a desire to come naked , whether as man or woman I do not yet know: but he is coming, he is compelling me, alas! Open your senses! Day is fading away, now evening is coming to all things, even to the best things; listen now, and see, you Higher Men, what devil, whether man or woman, this spirit of evening melancholy is! Thus spoke the old sorcerer, looked cunningly around and then seized his harp.  3 When the air grows clear, When the dew’s comfort Rains down upon the earth, Invisible and unheard - For dew the comforter Wears tender shoes like all that gently comforts: Do you then remember, do you, hot heart, How once you thirsted For heavenly tears and dew showers, Thirsted, scorched and weary, While on yellow grassy paths Wicked evening sunlight-glances Ran about you through dark trees, Blinding, glowing sunlight-glances, malicious? ‘The wooer of truth? You?’ – so they jeered - ‘No! Only a poet! An animal, cunning, preying, creeping, That has to lie, That knowingly, wilfully has to lie: Lusting for prey, Motley-masked, A mask to itself, A prey to itself - That – the wooer of truth? No! Only a fool! Only a poet! Only speaking motley, Crying out of fools-masks, Stalking around on deceitful word-bridges, On motley rainbows, Between a false heaven And a false earth, Soaring, hovering about - Only a fool! Only a poet! That – the wooer of truth? Not still, stiff, smooth, cold, Become an image, Become a god’s statue, Not set up before temples, A god’s watchman: No! enemy to such statues of truth, More at home in any wilderness than before temples, Full of cat’s wantonness, Leaping through every window, Swiftly! into every chance, Sniffing out every jungle, Sniffing with greedy longing, That you may run, Sinfully-healthy and motley and fair, In jungles among motley-speckled beasts of prey, Run with lustful lips, Happily jeering, happily hellish, happily blood-thirsty, Preying, creeping, lying: Or like the eagle staring Long, long into abysses, Into its abysses: Oh how they circle down, Under and in, Into ever deeper depths! Then, Suddenly, with straight aim, Quivering flight, They pounce on lambs , Headlong down, ravenous, Lusting for lambs, Angry at all lamb-souls, Fiercely angry at all that look.  Sheepish, lamb-eyed, curly-woolled, Grey with lamb-sheep kindliness! Thus, Eagle like, panther like, Are the poet’s desires, Are your desires under a thousand masks, You fool! You poet! You saw man As God and sheep: To rend the God in man As the sheep in man, And in rending to laugh - That, that is your blessedness! A panther’s and eagle’s blessedness! A poet’s and fool’s blessedness!’ When the air grows clear, When the moon’s sickle Creeps along, green, Envious, in the purple twilight: Enemy to day, With every step secretly Sickling down The hanging rose-gardens, Until they sink, Sink down, pale, down to night: So sank I once From my delusion of truth, From my daytime longings, Weary of day, sick with light, Sank downwards, down to evening, down to shadows: Scorched and thirsty With one truth: Do you remember, do you, hot heart, How you thirsted then? That I am banished From all truth, Only a fool! Only a poet! Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Funeral Song ‘Y ONDER is the grave-island, the silent island; yonder too are the graves of my youth.  I will bear thither an evergreen wreath of life.’ Resolving thus in my heart I fared over the sea.  O, you sights and visions of my youth! O, all you glances of love, you divine momentary glances! 17 How soon you perished! Today I think of you as my dead ones.  A sweet odour comes to me from you, my dearest dead ones, a heart-easing odour that banishes tears.  Truly, it moves and eases the solitary seafarer’s heart.  Still am I the richest and most-to-be-envied man – I, the most solitary! For I had you and you have me still: tell me, to whom have such rosy apples fallen from the tree as have fallen to me? Still am I heir and heritage of your love, blooming to your memory with many-coloured wild-growing virtues, O my most beloved ones! Ah, we were made for one another, you gentle, strange marvels; and you came to me and my longing not as timid birds – no, you came trusting to me, who also trusted.  Yes, made for faithfulness, like me, and for tender eternities: must I now name you by your unfaithfulness, you divine glances and moments: I have as yet learned no other name.  Truly, you perished too soon, you fugitives.  Yet you did not fly from me, nor did I fly from you: we are innocent towards one another in our unfaithfulness.  They put you to death, you song-birds of my hopes, in order to kill me ! Yes, the arrows of malice were always directed at you, my beloved ones – in order to strike at my heart! And they struck! You were always my heart’s dearest, my possession and my being-possessed: therefore you had to die young and all-too-early! They shot the arrow at the most vulnerable thing I possessed: and that was you, whose skin is like down and even more like the smile that dies at a glance! But I will say this to my enemies: What is any manslaughter compared with what you did to me! You did a worse thing to me than any manslaughter; you took from me the irretrievable – thus I speak to you, my enemies! You murdered my youth’s visions and dearest marvels! You took from me my playfellows, those blessed spirits I To their memory do I lay this wreath and this curse.  This curse upon you, my enemies! You have cut short my eternity, as a note is cut short in the cold night! It came to me hardly as the twinkling of divine eyes – as a moment! Thus in a happy hour my purity once spoke: ‘All creatures shall be divine to me.’ Then you surprised me with foul phantoms; alas, whither has that happy hour fled now? ‘All days shall be holy to me’ – thus the wisdom of my youth once spoke: truly, the speech of a joyful wisdom! But then you, my enemies, stole my nights from me and sold them to sleepless torment: alas, whither has that joyful wisdom fled now? Once I longed for happy bird-auspices: then you led an owl-monster across my path, an adverse sign.  Alas, whither did my tender longings flee then? I once vowed to renounce all disgust; then you transformed my kindred and neighbours into abscesses.  Alas, whither did my noblest vow flee then? Once, as a blind man, I walked on happy paths; then you threw filth in the blind man’s path: and now die old footpath disgusts him.  And when I achieved my most difficult task and celebrated the victory of my overcomings: then you made those whom I loved cry out that I hurt them most.  Truly, all that was your doing: you embittered my finest honey and the industry of my finest bees.  You have always sent the most insolent beggars to my liberality; you have always crowded the incurably shameless around my pity.  Thus you have wounded my virtues’ faith.  And when I brought my holiest thing as a sacrifice, straightway your ‘piety’ placed its fatter gifts beside it: so that my holiest thing choked in the smoke of your fat.  And once I wanted to dance as I had never yet danced: I wanted to dance beyond all heavens.  Then you lured away my favourite singer.  And then he struck up a gruesome, gloomy melody: alas, he trumpeted into my ears like a mournful horn! Murderous singer, instrument of malice, most innocent man! I stood prepared for the finest dance: then you murdered my ecstasy with your tones! I know how to speak the parable of the highest things only in the dance – and now my greatest parable has remained in my limbs unspoken! My highest hope has remained unspoken and unachieved! And all the visions and consolations of my youth are dead! How did I endure it? How did I recover from such wounds, how did I overcome them? How did my soul arise again from these graves? Yes, something invulnerable, unburiable is within me, something that rends rocks: it is called my Will .  Silently it steps and unchanging through the years.  It shall go its course upon my feet, my old Will; hard of heart and invulnerable is its temper.  I am invulnerable only in my heels.  You live there and are always the same, most patient one! You will always break out of all graves! In you too still live on all the unachieved things of my youth; and you sit as life and youth, hopefully, here upon yellow grave-ruins.  Yes, you are still my destroyer of all graves: Hail, my Will! And only where there are graves are there resurrections.  Thus sang Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Tree on the Mountainside Z ARATHUSTRA had noticed that a young man was avoiding him.  And as he was walking alone one evening through the mountains surrounding the town called The Pied Cow, behold! he found this young man leaning against a tree and gazing wearily into the valley.  Zarathustra grasped the tree beside which the young man was sitting and spoke thus: ‘If I wanted to shake this tree with my hands I should be unable to do it.  ‘But the wind, which we cannot see, torments it and bends it where it wishes.  It is invisible hands that torment and bend us the worst.’ At that the young man stood up in confusion and said: ‘I hear Zarathustra and I was just thinking of him.’ Zarathustra replied: ‘Why are you alarmed on that account? – Now it is with men as with this tree.  ‘The more it wants to rise into the heights and the light, the more determinedly do its roots strive earthwards, downwards, into the darkness, into the depths – into evil.’ ‘Yes, into evil!’ cried the young man.  ‘How is it possible you can uncover my soul?’ Zarathustra smiled and said: ‘There are many souls one will never uncover, unless one invents them first.’ ‘Yes, into evill’ cried the young man again.  ‘You have spoken the truth, Zarathustra.  Since I wanted to rise into the heights I have no longer trusted myself, and no one trusts me any more.  How did this happen? ‘I change too quickly: my today refutes my yesterday.  When I ascend I often jump over steps, and no step forgives me that.  ‘When I am aloft, I always find myself alone.  No one speaks to me, the frost of solitude makes me tremble.  What do I want in the heights? ‘My contempt and my desire increase together; the higher I climb, the more do I despise him who climbs.  What do I want in the heights? ‘How ashamed I am of my climbing and stumbling! How I scorn my violent panting! How I hate the man who can fly! How weary I am in the heights!’ Here the young man fell silent.  And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside which they were standing, and spoke thus: ‘This tree stands here alone on the mountainside; it has grown up high above man and animal.  ‘And if it wished to speak, it would find no one who understood it: so high has it grown.  ‘Now it waits and waits – yet what is it waiting for? It lives too near the seat of the clouds: is it waiting, perhaps, for the first lightning?’ When Zarathustra said this, the young man cried with violent gestures: ‘Yes, Zarathustra, you speak true.  I desired my destruction when I wanted to ascend into the heights, and you are the lightning for which I have been waiting! Behold, what have I been since you appeared among us? It is envy of you which has destroyed me!’ Thus spoke the young man and wept bitterly.  But Zarathustra kid his arm about him and drew him along with him.  And when they had been walking together for a while, Zarathustra began to speak thus: It breaks my heart.  Better than your words, your eye tells me all your peril.  You are not yet free, you still search for freedom.  Your search has fatigued you and made you too wakeful.  You long for the open heights, your soul thirsts for the stars.  But your bad instincts too thirst for freedom.  Your fierce dogs long for freedom; they bark for joy in their cellar when your spirit aspires to break open all prisons.  To me you are still a prisoner who imagines freedom: ah, such prisoners of the soul become clever, but also deceitful and base.  The free man of the spirit, too, must still purify himself.  Much of the prison and rottenness still remain within him: his eye still has to become pure.  Yes, I know your peril.  But, by my love and hope I entreat you: do not reject your love and hope! You still feel yourself noble, and the others, too, who dislike you and cast evil glances at you, still feel you are noble.  Learn that everyone finds the noble man an obstruction.  The good, too, find the noble man an obstruction: and even when they call him a good man they do so in order to make away with him.  The noble man wants to create new things and a new virtue.  The good man wants the old things and that the old things shall be preserved.  But that is not the danger for the noble man – that he may become a good man – but that he may become an impudent one, a derider, a destroyer.  Alas, I have known noble men who lost their highest hope.  And henceforth they slandered all high hopes.  Henceforth they lived impudently in brief pleasures, and they had hardly an aim beyond the day.  ‘Spirit is also sensual pleasure’ – thus they spoke.  Then the wings of their spirit broke: now it creeps around and it makes dirty what it feeds on.  Once they thought of becoming heroes: now they are sensualists.  The hero is to them an affliction and a terror.  But, by my love and hope I entreat you: do not reject the hero in your soul! Keep holy your highest hope! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA F RIEDRICH N IETZSCHE was born near Leipzig in 1844, the son of a Lutheran clergyman.  He attended the famous Pforta School, then went to university at Bonn and at Leipzig, where he studied philology and read Schopenhauer.  When he was only twenty-four he was appointed to the chair of classical philology at Basle University; he stayed there until his health forced him into retirement in 1879.  While at Basle he made and broke his friendship with Wagner, participated as an ambulance orderly in the Franco-Prussian War, and published The Birth of Tragedy (1872), Untimely Meditations (1873–6) and the first part of Human, All Too Human (1878; two supplements entitled Assorted Opinions and Maxims and The Wanderer and his Shadow followed in 1879 and 1880 respectively).  From 1880 until his final collapse in 1889, except for brief interludes, he divorced himself from everyday life and, supported by his university pension, he lived mainly in France, Italy and Switzerland.  The Dawn appeared in 1881 followed by The Gay Science in the autumn of 1882.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra was written between 1883 and 1885, and his last completed books were Ecce Homo , an autobiography, and Nietzsche contra Wagner .  He became insane in 1889 and remained in a condition of mental and physical paralysis until his death in 1900.  R.  J.  H OLLINGDALE translated eleven of Nietzsche’ books and published two books about him; he also translated works by, among others, Schopenhauer, Goethe, E.  T.  A.  Hoffman, Lichtenberg and Theodor Fontane, many of these for Penguin Classics.  He was the honorary president of the British Nietzsche Society.  R.  J.  Hollingdale died on 28 September 2001.  In its obituary The Times described him as ‘Britain’s foremost postwar Nietzsche specialist’ and the Guardian paid tribute to his ‘inspired gift for German translation’.  Richard Gott wrote that he ‘brought fresh generations – through fluent and intelligent translation – to read and relish Nietzsche’s inestimable thought’.  Cover Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Virtue that Makes Small 1 W HEN Zarathustra was again on firm land he did not go off straightway to his mountains and his cave, but made many journeys and asked many questions and inquired of this and that, so that he said jokingly of himself: ‘Behold a river that flows back to its source through many meanderings!’ For he wanted to learn what had been happening to men while he had been away: whether they had become bigger or smaller.  And once he saw a row of new houses, and he marvelled and said: What do these houses mean? Truly, no great soul put them up as its image! Did a silly child perhaps take them out of its toy-box? If only another child would put them back into its box! And these sitting-rooms and bedrooms: are men able to go in and out of them? They seem to have been made for dolls; or for dainty nibblers who perhaps let others nibble with them.  And Zarathustra stopped and considered.  At length he said sadly: ‘ Everything has become smaller! ‘Everywhere I see lower doors: anyone like me can still pass through them, but – he has to stoop! ‘Oh when shall I return to my home, where I shall no longer have to stoop – shall no longer have to stoop before the small men ’! And Zarathustra sighed and gazed into the distance.  The same day, however, he spoke his discourse upon the virtue that makes small.  2 I go among this people and keep my eyes open: they do not forgive me that I am not envious of their virtues.  They peck at me because I tell them: For small people small virtues are necessary – and because it is hard for me to understand that small people are necessary ! Here I am still like a cockerel in a strange farmyard, who is pecked at even by the hens; but I am not unfriendly to these hens on that account.  I am polite towards them, as towards every small vexation; to be prickly towards small things seems to me the wisdom of a hedgehog.  They all talk of me when they sit around the fire at evening – they talk of me, but no one thinks – of me! This is the new silence I have learned: their noise about me spreads a cloak over my thoughts.  They bluster among themselves: ‘What does this gloomy cloud want with us? Let us see that it does not bring us a pestilence!’ And recently a woman pulled back her child when it was coming towards me: ‘Take the children away!’ she cried; ‘such eyes scorch children’s souls.’ They cough when I speak: they think that coughing is an objection to strong winds – they know nothing of the raging of my happiness! ‘We have no time yet for Zarathustra’ – thus they object; but of what consequence is a time that ‘has no time’ for Zarathustra? And should they even praise me: how could I rest on their praise? Their praise is a barbed girdle to me: it scratches me even when I take it off.  And I have learned this, too, among them: he who praises appears to be giving back, in truth however he wants to be given more! Ask my foot if it likes their melodies of praise and enticement! Truly, to such a measure and tick-tock beat it likes neither to dance nor to stand still.  They would like to lure and commend me to small virtue; they would like to persuade my foot to the tick-tock measure of a small happiness.  I go among this people and keep my eyes open: they have become smaller and are becoming ever smaller: and their doctrine of happiness and virtue is the cause .  For they are modest even in virtue – for they want ease.  But only a modest virtue is compatible with ease.  To be sure, even they learn in their own way how to stride and to stride forward: that is what I call their limping .  Therewith they become a hindrance to anyone who is in a hurry.  And some of them go forward and at the same time look backward with a stiff neck: I like to run up against them.  Foot and eye should not lie, nor give one another the lie.  But there is much lying among the small people.  Some of them will , but most of them are only willed .  Some of them are genuine, but most of them are bad actors.  There are unconscious actors among them and involuntary actors – the genuine are always rare, especially genuine actors.  There is little manliness here: therefore their women make themselves manly.  For only he who is sufficiently a man will – redeem the woman in woman.  And I have found this hypocrisy the worst among them: that even those who command affect the virtues of those who obey.  ‘I serve, you serve, we serve’ – so here even the hypocrisy of the rulers intones – and alas, if the first ruler is only the first servant! Ah, my eyes’ curiosity has strayed even into their hypocrisies; and I have divined well all their fly-happiness and their humming around sunny window-panes.  I see as much weakness as goodness.  As much weakness as justice and pity.  They are frank, honest, and kind to one another, as grains of sand are frank, honest, and kind to grains of sand.  To embrace modestly a little happiness – that they call ‘submission’! And at the same time they are looking out for a new little happiness.  Fundamentally they want one thing most of all: that nobody shall do them harm.  So they steal a march on everyone and do good to everyone.  This, however, is cowardice : although it be called ‘virtue’.  And when they speak harshly, these little people, I hear in it only their hoarseness – every draught, in fact, makes them hoarse.  They are clever, their virtues have clever fingers.  But they lack fists, their fingers do not know how to fold into fists.  To them, virtue is what makes modest and tame: with it they make the wolf into a dog and man himself into man’s best domestic animal.  ‘We have set our chairs down in the middle ’ – that is what their smirking tells me – ‘and as far away from dying warriors as from contented swine.’ This, however, is – mediocrity : although it be called moderation.  3 I go among this people and let fall many a word; but they know neither how to take nor to keep.  They are surprised that I have not come to rail at their lusts and vices; and truly, I have not come to warn against pickpockets, either! They are surprised that I am not prepared to improve and sharpen their cleverness: as if they had not already sufficient wiseacres, whose voices grate on me like slate-pencils! And when I cry: ‘Curse all the cowardly devils within you who would like to whimper and clasp their hands and worship,’ then they cry: ‘Zarathustra is godless.’ And this is especially the cry of their teachers of submission; but it is into precisely their ears that I love to shout: Yes! I am Zarathustra the Godless! These teachers of submission! Wherever there is anything small and sick and scabby, there they crawl like lice; and only my disgust stops me from cracking them.  Well then! This is my sermon for their ears: I am Zarathustra the Godless, who says ‘Who is more godless than I, that I may rejoice in his teaching?’ I am Zarathustra the Godless: where shall I find my equal? All those who give themselves their own will and renounce all submission, they are my equals.  I am Zarathustra the Godless: I cook every chance in my pot.  And only when it is quite cooked do I welcome it as my food.  And truly, many a chance came imperiously to me: but my will spoke to it even more imperiously, then it went down imploringly on its knees – imploring shelter and love with me, and urging in wheedling tones: ‘Just see, O Zarathustra, how a friend comes to a friend!’ But why do I speak where no one has my kind of ears? And so I will shout it out to all the winds: You will become smaller and smaller, you small people! You will crumble away, you comfortable people! You will yet perish – through your many small virtues, through your many small omissions, through your many small submissions! Too indulgent, too yielding: that is the state of your soil! But in order to grow big , a tree wants to strike hard roots into hard rocks! Even what you omit weaves at the web of mankind’s future; even your nothing is a spider’s web and a spider that lives on the future’s blood.  And when you take, it is like stealing, you small virtuous people; but even among rogues, honour says: ‘One should steal only where one cannot plunder.’ ‘It is given’ – that is also a doctrine of submission.  But I tell you, you comfortable people: it is taken , and will be taken more and more from you! 29 Oh, that you would put from you all half willing, and decide upon lethargy as you do upon action! Oh, that you understood my saying: ‘Always do what you will – but first be such as can will! ‘Always love your neighbour as yourselves – but first be such as love themselves – ‘such as love with a great love, such as love with a great contempt!’ Thus speaks Zarathustra the Godless.  But why do I speak where no one has my kind of ears? Here it is yet an hour too early for me.  Among this people I am my own forerunner, my own cock-crow through dark lanes.  But their hour is coming! And mine too is coming! Hourly will they become smaller, poorer, more barren – poor weeds! poor soil! And soon they shall stand before me like arid grass and steppe, and truly! weary of themselves – and longing for fire rather than for water! O blessed hour of the lightning! O mystery before noontide! One day I shall turn them into running fire and heralds with tongues of flame – one day they shall proclaim with tongues of flame: It is coming, it is near, the great noontide ! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Before Sunrise O SKY above me! O pure, deep sky! You abyss of light! Gazing into you, I tremble with divine desires.  To cast myself into your height – that is my depth! To hide myself in your purity – that is my innocence! The god is veiled by his beauty: thus you hide your stars.  You do not speak: thus you proclaim to me your wisdom.  You have risen for me today, mute over the raging sea; your love and your modesty speak a revelation to my raging soul.  That you have come to me, beautiful, veiled in your beauty; that you have spoken to me mutely, manifest in your wisdom: Oh how should I not divine all that is modest in your soul! You came to me before the sun, to me the most solitary man.  We have been friends from the beginning: we have grief and terror and world in common; we have even the sun in common.  We do not speak to one another, because we know too much: we are silent together, we smile our knowledge to one another.  Are you not the light of my fire? Do you not have the sister-soul of my insight? Together we learned everything; together we learned to mount above ourselves to ourselves and to smile uncloudedly – to smile uncloudedly down from bright eyes and from miles away when under us compulsion and purpose and guilt stream like rain.  And when I wandered alone, what did my soul hunger after by night and on treacherous paths? And when I climbed mountains, whom did I always seek, if not you, upon mountains? And all my wandering and mountain-climbing: it was merely a necessity and an expedient of clumsiness: my whole will desires only fly , to fly into you ! And what have I hated more than passing clouds and all that defiles you? And I have hated even my own hatred, because it defiled you! I dislike the passing clouds, these stealthy cats of prey: they take from you and from me what we have in common – the vast and boundless declaration of Yes and Amen.  We dislike these mediators and mixers, the passing clouds: these half-and-halfers, who have learned neither to bless nor to curse from the heart.  I would rather sit in a barrel under a closed sky, rather sit in an abyss without a sky, than see you, luminous sky, defiled by passing clouds! And often I longed to bind them fast with jagged golden wires of lightning, so that I, like the thunder, might drum upon their hollow bellies – an angry drummer, because they rob me of your Yes! and Amen! O sky above me, you pure sky! You luminous sky! You abyss of light! – because they rob me of my Yes! and Amen! For I would rather have noise and thunder and storm-curses than this cautious, uncertain feline repose; and among men, too, I hate most all soft-walkers and half-and-halfers and uncertain, hesitating passing clouds.  And ‘He who cannot bless shall learn to curse!’ – this clear teaching fell to me from the dear sky, this star stands in my sky even on dark nights.  I, however, am one who blesses and declares Yes, if only you are around me, you pure, luminous sky! You abyss of light I – then into all abysses do I carry my consecrating declaration Yes.  I have become one who blesses and one who declares Yes: and for that I wrestled long and was a wrestler, so that I might one day have my hands free for blessing.  This, however, is my blessing: To stand over everything as its own sky, as its round roof, its azure bell and eternal certainty: and happy is he who thus blesses! For all things are baptized at the fount of eternity and beyond good and evil; good and evil themselves, however, are only intervening shadows and damp afflictions and passing clouds.  Truly, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach: ‘Above all things stands the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, the heaven of accident, the heaven of wantonness.’ 27 ‘Lord Chance’ 28 – he is the world’s oldest nobility, which I have given back to all things; I have released them from servitude under purpose.  I set this freedom and celestial cheerfulness over all things like an azure bell when I taught that no ‘eternal will’ acts over them and through them.  I set this wantonness and this foolishness in place of that will when I taught: ‘With all things one thing is impossible – rationality!’ A little reason, to be sure, a seed of wisdom scattered from star to star – this leaven is mingled with all things: for the sake of foolishness is wisdom mingled with all things! A little wisdom is no doubt possible; but I have found this happy certainty in all things: that they prefer – to dance on the feet of chance.  O sky above me, you pure, lofty sky! This is now your purity to me, that there is no eternal reason-spider and spider’s web in you – that you are to me a dance floor for divine chances, that you are to me a gods’ table for divine dice and dicers! But are you blushing? Did I say something unspeakable? Did I slander you when I meant to bless you? Or is it the shame of our being together which makes you blush? Are you telling me to go and be silent because now – day is coming? The world is deep: and deeper than day has ever comprehended.  Not everything may be spoken in the presence of day.  But day is coming: so let us part! O sky above me, you modest, glowing sky! O you, my happiness before sunrise! Day is coming: so let us part! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra NIETZSCHE Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Preachers of Death T HERE are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom departure from life must be preached.  The earth is full of the superfluous, life has been corrupted by the many-too-many.  Let them be lured by ‘eternal life’ out of this life! Yellow men or black men: that is what the preachers of death are called.  But I want to show them to you in other colours.  There are the dreadful creatures who carry a beast of prey around within them, and have no choice except lusts or self-mortification.  And even their lusts are self-mortification.  They have not yet even become men, these dreadful creatures.  Let them preach departure from life and depart themselves! There are the consumptives of the soul: they are hardly born before they begin to die and to long for doctrines of weariness and renunciation.  They would like to be dead, and we should approve their wish! Let us guard against awakening these dead men and damaging these living coffins.  They encounter an invalid or an old man or a corpse; and straightway they say ‘Life is refuted!’ But only they are refuted, they and their eye that sees only one aspect of existence.  Muffled in deep depression, and longing for the little accidents that bring about death: thus they wait and clench their teeth.  Or: they snatch at sweets and in doing so mock their childishness: they cling to their straw of life and mock that they are still clinging to a straw.  Their wisdom runs: ‘He who goes on living is a fool, but we are such fools! And precisely that is the most foolish thing in life!’ ‘Life is only suffering’ – thus others of them speak, and they do not lie: so see to it that you ’ cease to live! So see to it that the life which is only suffering ceases! And let the teaching of your virtue be: ‘You shall kill yourself! You shall steal away from yourself!’ ‘Lust is sin’ – thus say some who preach death – ‘let us go aside and beget no children!’ ‘Giving birth is laborious’ – say others – ‘why go on giving birth? One gives birth only to unhappy children!’ And they too are preachers of death.  ‘Men are to be pitied’ – thus say others again.  ‘Take what I have! Take what I am! By so much less am I bound to life!’ If they were compassionate from the very heart they would seek to make their neighbours disgusted with life.  To be evil -that would be their true good.  But they want to escape from life: what is it to them that, with their chains and gifts, they bind others still more firmly to it? And you too, you to whom life is unrestrained labour and anxiety: are you not very weary of life? Are you not very ripe for the sermon of death? All of you, to whom unrestrained labour, and the swift, the new, the strange, are dear, you endure yourselves ill, your industry is flight and will to forget yourselves.  If you believed more in life, you would devote yourselves less to the moment.  But you have insufficient capacity for waiting – or even for laziness! Everywhere resound the voices of those who preach death: and the earth is full of those to whom death must be preached.  Or ‘eternal life’: it is all the same to me – provided they pass away quickly! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Dance Song O NE evening Zarathustra was walking through the forest with his disciples; and as he was looking for a well, behold, he came upon a green meadow quietly surrounded by trees and bushes: and in the meadow girls were dancing together.  As soon as the girls recognized Zarathustra they ceased their dance; Zarathustra, however, approached them with a friendly air and spoke these words: Do not cease your dance, sweet girls! No spoil-sport has come to you with an evil eye, no enemy of girls.  I am God’s advocate with the Devil; he, however, is the Spirit of Gravity.  How could I be enemy to divine dancing, you nimble creatures? or to girls’ feet with fair ankles? To be sure, I am a forest and a night of dark trees: but he who is not afraid of my darkness will find rosebowers too under my cypresses.  And he will surely find too the little god whom girls love best: he lies beside the fountain, still, with his eyes closed.  Truly, he has fallen asleep in broad daylight, the idler! Has he been chasing butterflies too much? Do not be angry with me, fair dancers, if I chastise the little god a little I Perhaps he will cry out and weep, but he is laughable even in weeping! And with tears in his eyes, he shall ask you for a dance; and I myself will sing a song for his dance.  A dance-song and a mocking-song on the Spirit of Gravity, my supreme, most powerful devil, who they say is ‘the lord of the earth’.  And this is the song Zarathustra sang as cupid and the girls danced together: Lately I looked into your eye, O Life! And I seemed to sink into the unfathomable.  But you pulled me out with a golden rod; you laughed mockingly when I called you unfathomable.  ‘All fish talk like that,’ you said; ‘what they cannot fathom is unfathomable.  ‘But I am merely changeable and untamed and in everything a woman, and no virtuous one.  ‘Although you men call me “profound” or “faithful”, “eternal”, “mysterious”.  ‘But you men always endow us with your own virtues – ah, you virtuous men!’ Thus she laughed, the incredible woman; but I never believe her and her laughter when she speaks evil of herself.  And when I spoke secretly with my wild Wisdom, she said to me angrily: ‘You will, you desire, you love, that is the only reason you praise Life!’ Then I almost answered crossly and told the truth to my angry Wisdom; and one cannot answer more crossly than when one ‘tells the truth’ to one’s Wisdom.  This then is the state of affairs between us three.  From the heart of me I love only Life – and in truth, I love her most of all when I hate her! But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is because she very much reminds me of Life! She has her eyes, her laughter, and even her little golden fishing-rod: how can I help it that they both look so alike? And when Life once asked me: ‘Who is she then, this Wisdom?’ – then I said eagerly: ‘Ah yes! Wisdom! ‘One thirsts for her and is not satisfied, one looks at her through veils, one snatches at her through nets.  ‘Is she fair? I know not! But the cleverest old fish are still lured by her.  ‘She is changeable and defiant; I have often seen her bite her lip and comb her hair against the grain.  ‘Perhaps she is wicked and false, and in everything a wench; but when she speaks ill of herself, then precisely is she most seductive.’ When I said this to Life, she laughed maliciously and closed her eyes.  ‘But whom are you speaking of?’ she asked, ‘of me, surely? ‘And if you are right – should you tell me that to my face? But now speak of your Wisdom, too!’ Ah, and then you opened your eyes again, O beloved Life! And again I seemed to sink into the unfathomable.  Thus sang Zarathustra.  But when the dance had ended and the girls had gone away, he grew sad.  The sun has long since set (he said at last); the meadow is damp, coolness is coming from the forests.  Something strange and unknown is about me, looking thoughtfully at me.  What I are you still living, Zarathustra? Why? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is it not folly to go on living? Ah, my friends, it is the evening that questions thus within me..  Forgive me my sadness! Evening has come: forgive me that it has become evening! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Science T HUS sang the sorcerer; and all who were present went like birds unawares into the net of his cunning and melancholy voluptuousness.  Only the conscientious man of the spirit was not captured: he quickly snatched the harp away from the sorcerer and cried: ‘Air! Let in good air! Let Zarathustra in! You are making this cave sultry and poisonous, you evil old sorcerer! ‘You seduce to unknown desires and wildernesses, you false, subtle man.  And alas, when such as you chatter and make ado about truth ! ‘Woe to all free spirits who are not on their guard against such sorcerers! Their freedom is done with: you teach and lure back into prisons, ‘you old melancholy devil, a luring bird-call sounds from your lamenting, you are like those who with their praise of chastity secretly invite to voluptuousness!’ Thus spoke the conscientious man of the spirit; the old sorcerer, however, looked around him, enjoyed his victory, and on that account swallowed the displeasure the conscientious man had caused him.  ‘Be quiet!’ he said in a modest voice, ‘good songs want to echo well; one should be long silent after good songs.  ‘That is what all of them are doing, these Higher Men.  But you, perhaps, have understood little of my song? There is little of the spirit of sorcery in you.’ ‘You praise me’, replied the conscientious man, ‘when you separate me from yourself.  Very well! But you others, what do I see? You are all sitting there with lustful eyes: ‘You free souls, where has your freedom fled! You almost seem like men who have been gazing long at wicked girls dancing naked: your very souls are dancing! ‘There must be more of that which the sorcerer called his evil spirit of sorcery and deceit in you, you Higher Men -we must surely be different.  ‘And truly, we talked and thought together enough, before Zarathustra came home to his cave, for me to know: we are different.  ‘We seek different things – even up here, you and I.  For I seek more security , that is why I came to Zarathustra.  For he is still the surest tower and will ‘ – today, when everything is tottering, when all the earth quakes.  But you, when I see what eyes you make, almost seem to me to be seeking more insecurity , ‘more horror, more danger, more earthquaking.  You have a desire, I almost think, forgive me my presumption, you Higher Men, ‘you have a desire for the worst, most dangerous kind of life that terrifies me the most, for the life of wild animals, for the forests, caves, steep mountains, and labyrinths.  ‘And it is not those who lead out of danger that please you best, but those who lead you astray from all paths, the misleaders.  But if you actually harbour such desires, they seem to me, nevertheless, to be impossible .  ‘For fear – that is man’s original and fundamental sensation; everything is explained by fear, original sin and original virtue.  From fear grew also my virtue, which is called: science.  ‘For fear of wild animals – that has been fostered in man the longest, including the animal he hides and fears within himself- Zarathustra calls it “the beast within”.  ‘This protracted, ancient fear at length grown subtle, spiritual, intellectual – today, it seems to me, it is called: science .’ Thus spoke the conscientious man; but Zarathustra, who had just come back to his cave and had heard and understood the last discourse, threw the conscientious man a handful of roses and laughed at his ‘truths’.  ‘What,’ he cried, ‘what did I just hear? Truly, I think you are a fool, or I myself am one: and I shall straightway stand your “truth” on its head.  ‘For fear – is the exception with us.  Courage, however, and adventure and joy in the unknown, the unattempted – courage seems to me the whole pre-history of man.  ‘He has envied the wildest, most courageous animals all their virtues and robbed them of them: only thus did he become – man.  ‘This courage, at length grown subtle, spiritual, intellectual, this human courage with eagle’s wings and serpent’s wisdom: this , it seems to me, is today called – ’ ‘Zarathustra !’ all those sitting together cried as if from a single mouth and burst into a great peal of laughter; and it was as if a heavy cloud had risen from off them.  Even the sorcerer laughed and said prudently: ‘Well! My evil spirit has departed! ‘And did I myself not warn you against him, when I said he was a deceiver, a spirit of deceit and lies? ‘And especially when he shows himself naked.  But how can I prevent his pranks I Did I create him and the world? ‘Very well! Let us be good again and of good cheer I And although Zarathustra looks ill-temperedly – just see him! he is angry with me: ‘before night comes he will again learn to love and praise me, he cannot live long without committing such follies.  ‘He – loves his enemies: he understands this art better than anyone I have seen.  But he takes revenge for that – on his friends!’ Thus spoke the old sorcerer, and the Higher Men applauded him: so that Zarathustra went round and mischievously and lovingly shook hands with his friends, like one who has to make amends and apologize to everyone for something.  As he came to the door of his cave, however, he already felt again a desire for the good air outside and for his animals, and he was about to slip out.

Do you want to see the tarantula itself? Here hangs its web: touch it and make it tremble.  Here it comes docilely: Welcome, tarantula! Your triangle and symbol sit black upon your back; and I know too what sits within your soul.  Revenge sits within your soul: a black scab grows wherever you bite; with revenge your poison makes the soul giddy! Thus do I speak to you in parables, you who make the soul giddy, you preachers of equality ! You are tarantulas and dealers in hidden revengefulness! But I will soon bring your hiding places to light: therefore I laugh my laughter of the heights in your faces.  I pull at your web that your rage may lure you from your cave of lies and your revenge may bound forward from behind your word ‘justice’.  For that man may be freed from the bonds of revenge : that is the bridge to my highest hope and a rainbow after protracted storms.  But, naturally, the tarantulas would have it differently.  ‘That the world may become full of the storms of our revenge, let precisely that be called justice by us’ – thus they talk together.  ‘We shall practise revenge and outrage against all who are not as we are’ – thus the tarantula-hearts promise themselves.  ‘And “will to equality” – that itself shall henceforth be the name of virtue; and we shall raise outcry against everything that has power!’ You preachers of equality, thus from you the tyrant-madness of impotence cries for ‘equality’: thus your most secret tyrant-appetite disguises itself in words of virtue.  Soured self-conceit, repressed envy, perhaps your fathers’ self-conceit and envy: they burst from you as a flame and madness of revenge.  What the father kept silent the son speaks out; and I often found the son the father’s revealed secret.  They resemble inspired men: but it is not the heart that inspires them – it is revenge.  And when they become refined and cold, it is not their mind, it is their envy that makes them refined and cold.  Their jealousy leads them upon thinkers’ paths too; and this is the mark of their jealousy – they always go too far: so that their weariness has at last to lie down and sleep even on the snow.  Revenge rings in all their complaints, a malevolence is in all their praise; and to be judge seems bliss to them.  Thus, however, I advise you, my friends: Mistrust all in whom the urge to punish is strong! They are people of a bad breed and a bad descent; the executioner and the bloodhound peer from out their faces.  Mistrust all those who talk much about their justice! Truly, it is not only honey that their souls lack.  And when they call themselves ‘the good and just’, do not forget that nothing is lacking to make them into Pharisees except – power! My friends, I do not want to be confused with others or taken for what I am not.  There are those who preach my doctrine of life: yet are at the same time preachers of equality, and tarantulas.  That they speak well of life, these poison spiders, although they sit in their caves and with their backs turned on life, is because they want to do harm by speaking well of life.  They want to do harm to those who now possess power: for with those the preaching of death is still most at home.  If it were otherwise, the tarantulas would teach otherwise: and it is precisely they who were formerly the best world-slanderers and heretic-burners.  I do not want to be confused with these preachers of equality, nor taken for one of them.  For justice speaks thus to me : ‘Men are not equal.’ And they should not become so, either! For what were my love of the Superman if I spoke otherwise? They should press on to the future across a thousand bridges and gangways, and there should be more and more war and inequality among them: thus my great love makes me speak! They should become devisers of emblems and phantoms in their enmity, and with their emblems and phantoms they should fight together the supreme fight! Good and evil, and rich and poor, and noble and mean, and all the names of the virtues: they should be weapons and ringing symbols that life must overcome itself again and again! Life wants to raise itself on high with pillars and steps; it wants to gaze into the far distance and out upon joyful splendour – that is why it needs height! And because it needs height, it needs steps and conflict between steps and those who climb them! Life wants to climb and in climbing overcome itself.  And just look, my friends! Here, where the tarantula’s cave is, there rises up the ruins of an old temple – just look at it with enlightened eyes! Truly, he who once towered up his thoughts in stone here knew as well as the wisest about the secret of all life! That there is battle and inequality and war for power and predominance even in beauty: he teaches us that here in the dearest parable.  How divinely vault and arch here oppose one another in the struggle: how they strive against one another with light and shadow, these divinely-striving things.  Beautiful and assured as these, let us also be enemies, my friends! Let us divinely strive against one another! Ha! Now the tarantula, my old enemy, has bitten me! Divinely beautiful and assured, it bit me in the finger! ‘There must be punishment and justice’ – thus it thinks: ‘here he shall not sing in vain songs in honour of enmity!’ Yes, the tarantula has revenged itself I And alas, now it will make my soul, too, giddy with revenge! But so that I may not veer round, tie me tight to this pillar, my friends! I would rather be even a pillar-saint than a whirlpool of revengefulness! Truly, Zarathustra is no veering wind nor whirlwind; and although he is a dancer, he is by no means a tarantella dancer! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Apostates 1 A LAS , everything that lately stood green and motley in this meadow already lies faded and grey! And how much honey of hope have I carried from here into my beehives! All these young hearts have already grown old – and not even old! only weary, common, comfortable: they describe it: ‘We have grown pious again.’ But lately I saw them running out in the early morning with bold feet: but the feet of their knowledge grew weary and now they slander even their morning boldness! Truly, many of them once lifted their legs like a dancer, the laughter in my wisdom beckoned to them: then they considered.  And now I have seen them bent – to creep to the Cross.  Once they fluttered around light and freedom like flies and young poets.  A little older, a little colder: and already they are mystifiers and mutterers and stay-at-homes.  Did their hearts perhaps despair because solitude devoured me like a whale? Did their ears perhaps listen long and longingly in vain for me and for my trumpet and herald calls? Alas! They are always few whose heart possesses a long-enduring courage and wantonness; and in such, the spirit, too, is patient.  The remainder, however, are cowardly .  The remainder: that is always the majority, the commonplace, the superfluity, the many-too-many – all these are cowardly! He who is of my sort will also encounter experiences of my sort, so that his first companions must be corpses and buffoons.  His second companions, however, will call themselves his believers : a lively flock, full of love, full of folly, full of adolescent adoration.  He among men who is of my sort should not grapple his heart to these believers; he who knows fickle-cowardly human nature should not believe in these springs and many-coloured meadows! If they could do otherwise, they would choose otherwise.  The half-and-half spoil every whole.  Why complain because leaves wither? Let them fall, let them go, O Zarathustra, and do not complain I Rather blow among them with rustling winds – blow among these leaves, O Zarathustra: so that all that is withered may run from you the faster.  2 ‘We have grown pious again’ – thus these apostates confess; and many of them are still too cowardly to confess it.  I look into their eyes, then I tell them to their face and to the blushes of their cheeks: You are those who again pray ! But it is a disgrace to pray! Not for everyone, but for you and me and for whoever else has his conscience in his head.  For joy it is a disgrace to pray! You know it well: the cowardly devil in you who would like to clasp his hands and to fold his arms and to take it easier: – it was this cowardly devil who persuaded you: ‘There is a God!’ Through that , however, have you become one of those who dread the light, whom light never lets rest; now you must stick your head deeper every day into night and fog! And truly, you have chosen well the hour: for even now the night-birds have again flown out.  The hour has arrived for all people who fear the light, the evening hour of ease when there is no – ‘ease’ for them.  I hear and smell it: the hour for their chase and procession has arrived; not indeed for a wild chase, but for a tame, lame, snuffling, soft-walker’s and soft-prayer’s chase – for a chase after soulful hypocrites: all mousetraps of the heart have now again been set! And wherever I raise a curtain, a little night-moth comes fluttering out.  Has it perhaps been crouching there with another little night-moth? For everywhere I smell little hidden communities; and wherever there are closets, there are new devotees in them and the atmosphere of devotees.  They sit together on long evenings and say: ‘Let us again become as little children and say Dear God!’ – ruined in mouth and stomach by the pious confectioners.  Or they observe on long evenings a cunning, lurking Cross-spider, which preaches prudence to the spiders themselves and teaches: ‘There is good spinning under Crosses!’ Or they sit all day with fishing-rods beside swamps and for that reason think themselves deep; but he who fishes where there are no fish I do not call even superficial! Or they learn to play the harp in pious-joyful style with a song-poet who would like to harp his way into the hearts of young women – for he has grown weary of the old women and their praises.  Or they learn to shudder with a learned half-madman who waits in darkened rooms so that the spirits may come to him – and the spirit 30 has quite departed! Or they listen to an old, roving, whistling tramp who has learned from the distressful winds the distress of tones; now he whistles like the wind and preaches distress in distressful tones.  And some of them have even become night-watchmen: now they know how to blow horns and to go around at night and awaken old things that have long been asleep.  I heard five sayings about old things last night beside the garden wall: they came from such old, distressed, dried-up night-watchmen: ‘For a father he does not look after his children enough: human fathers do it better!’ ‘He is too old! He no longer looks after his children at all’-thus the other night-watchman answered.  ‘Has he any children? No one can prove it, if he doesn’t prove it himself! I have long wished he would prove it thoroughly for once.’ ‘Prove it? As if he has ever proved anything! He finds it hard to prove things; he thinks it very important that people should believe him.’ ‘Yes, yes! Belief makes him happy, belief in him.  Old people are like that I So shall we be, too!’ Thus the two old night-watchmen and light-scarecrows spoke together and thereupon blew their horns distressfully: so it happened last night beside the garden wall.  My heart, however, writhed with laughter and was like to break and knew not where to go and sank into the midriff.  Truly, it will yet be the death of me, to choke with laughter when I see asses intoxicated and hear night-watchmen thus doubt God.  For has not the time for all such doubts long since passed? Who may still awaken such old, sleeping, light-shunning things! With the old gods, they have long since met their end – and truly, they had a fine, merry, divine ending! They did not ‘fade away in twilight’ 31 – that is a lie! On the contrary: they once – laughed themselves to death! That happened when the most godless saying proceeded from a god himself, the saying: ‘There is one God! You shall have no other gods before me!’ – an old wrath-beard of a god, a jealous god, thus forgot himself: And all the gods laughed then and rocked in their chairs and cried: ‘Is not precisely this godliness, that there are gods but no God?’ He who has ears to hear, let him hear.  Thus spoke Zarathustra in the town which he loved and which is called ‘The Pied Cow’.  For from here he had only two days to go before arriving again at his cave and his animals; and his soul rejoiced continually at the nearness of his home-coming.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Voluntary Beggar W HEN Zarathustra had left the ugliest man he felt chilled and alone: for he had absorbed much coldness and loneliness, to such an extent that even his limbs had grown colder.  But he climbed on, up hill, down dale, past green pastures but also over wild, stony courses where no doubt an impatient brook had formerly made its bed: then all at once he grew warmer and more cheerful.  ‘What has happened to me?’ he asked himself.  ‘Something warm and living refreshes me, it must be nearby.  ‘Already I am less alone; unknown companions and brothers circle about me, their warm breath touches my soul.’ But when he peered about him and sought the comforters of his loneliness, behold, they were cows standing together on a hillock; it was their nearness and odour that had warmed his heart.  These cows, however, seemed to be listening eagerly to a speaker, and paid no heed to him who approached.  And when Zarathustra was quite near them he clearly heard a human voice speaking from out the midst of the cows; and apparently they had all turned their heads towards the speaker.  Then Zarathustra eagerly sprang up the hillock and pulled the animals away, for he feared that here someone had had an accident, which the sympathy of cows could hardly remedy.  But in this he was deceived; for behold, there on the ground sat a man who appeared to be persuading the animals to have no fear of him, a peaceable man and mountain sermonizer out of whose eyes goodness itself preached.  ‘What do you seek here?’ cried Zarathustra in surprise.  ‘What do I seek here?’ he answered: ‘the same as you seek, you peace-breaker! That is, happiness on earth.  ‘To that end, however, I may learn from these cows.  For, let me tell you, I have already been talking to them half a morning and they were just about to reply to me.  Why do you disturb them? ‘If we do not alter and become as cows, we shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  For there is one thing we should learn from them: rumination.  ‘And truly, if a man should gain the whole world and not learn this one thing, rumination: what would it profit him! He would not be free from his affliction, ‘his great affliction: that, however, is today called disgust .  Who today has not his heart, mouth, and eyes filled with disgust? You too! You too! But regard these cows!’ Thus spoke the mountain sermonizer and then turned his glance upon Zarathustra, for up to then it had rested lovingly upon the cows: at that, however, he changed.  ‘Who is that I am speaking with?’ he cried, startled, and jumped up from the ground.  ‘This is the man without disgust, this is Zarathustra himself, the overcomer of the great disgust, this is the eye, this is the mouth, this is the heart of Zarathustra himself.’ And as he spoke thus he kissed the hands of him to whom he spoke with overflowing eyes, and behaved like someone to whom a valuable gift and jewel has unexpectedly fallen from heaven.  The cows, however, looked on and were amazed.  ‘Do not speak of me, you strange, friendly man!’ said Zarathustra, restraining his affection, ‘first speak to me of yourself! Are you not the voluntary beggar who once threw away great riches, ‘ – who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich, and fled to the poor that he might give them his abundance and his heart? But they received him not.’ ‘But they received me not,’ said the voluntary beggar, ‘you know that.  So at last I went to the animals and to these cows.’ ‘Then you learned’, Zarathustra interrupted the speaker, ‘how it is harder to give well than to take well, and that to give well is an art and the ultimate, subtlest master-art of kindness.’ ‘These days especially,’ answered the voluntary beggar: ‘for today everything base has become rebellious and reserved and in its own way haughty: that is, in the mob’s way.  ‘For the hour has come, you know it, for the great, evil, protracted, slow rebellion of the mob and the slaves: it grows and grows! ‘Now all benevolence and petty giving provokes the base; and let the over-rich be on their guard! ‘Whoever today lets drops fall like a big-bellied bottle out of a too-narrow neck – people like to break the necks of such bottles today.  ‘Lustful greed, bitter envy, sour vindictiveness, mob pride: all this threw itself in my face.  It is no longer true that the poor are blessed.  The kingdom of heaven, however, is with the cows.’ ‘And why is it not with the rich?’ asked Zarathustra, tempting him, as he restrained the cows which were sniffing familiarly at the man of peace.  ‘Why do you tempt me?’ answered the latter.  ‘You yourself know better even than I.  For what drove me to the poorest, O Zarathustra? Was it not disgust with our richest? ‘ – disgust with those punished by riches, who glean advantage from all kinds of sweepings, with cold eyes, rank thoughts, disgust with this rabble that stinks to heaven, ‘disgust with this gilded, debased mob whose fathers were pick-pockets or carrion-birds or ragmen with compliant, lustful, forgetful wives – for they are all of them not far from whores – ‘mob above, mob below! What are “poor” and “rich” today! I unlearned this distinction – then I fled away, far away and ever farther, until I came to these cows.’ Thus spoke the man of peace and himself snorted and perspired as he spoke: so that the cows were again amazed.  Zarathustra, however, looked him in the face with a smile all the while he was speaking so sternly, and then silently shook his head.  ‘You do violence to yourself, mountain sermonizer, when you use such stern words.  Neither your mouth nor your eyes were made for such sternness.  ‘Nor your stomach either, as I think: that opposes all such raging and hating and over-frothing.  Your stomach wants gentler things: you are no butcher.  ‘On the contrary, you seem to me a man of plants and roots.  Perhaps you grind corn.  But you are certainly disinclined to fleshy pleasures and love honey.’ ‘You have divined me well,’ answered the voluntary beggar with lightened heart.  ‘I love honey, I also grind corn, for I have sought what tastes well and produces sweet breath: ‘also what takes a long time, a day’s work and a day’s chewing for gentle idlers and sluggards.  ‘To be sure, these cows have attained the greatest proficiency in it: they have devised rumination and lying in the sun.  And they abstain from all heavy thoughts that innate the heart.’ ‘Very well!’ said Zarathustra: ‘you shall see my animals, too, my eagle and my serpent – there is not their like on earth today.  ‘Behold, yonder leads the way to my cave: be its guest tonight.  And speak with my animals of the happiness of animals, ‘until I return home myself.  For now a cry of distress calls me hurriedly away from you.  You will find new honey, too, at my cave, golden honey in the comb, cold as ice: eat it! ‘But now straightway take leave of your cows, you strange, friendly man! although it may be hard for you.  For they are your warmest friends and teachers!’ ‘Except one, whom I love more,’ answered the voluntary beggar.  ‘You yourself are good, and even better than a cow, O Zarathustra!’ ‘Away, away with you! you arrant flatterer!’ cried Zarathustra mischievously, ‘why do you spoil me with such praise and honey of flattery?’ ‘Away, away from me!’ he cried again and swung his stick at the affectionate beggar; he, however, ran nimbly away.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Chastity I LOVE the forest.  It is bad to live in towns: too many of the lustful live there.  Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer than into the dreams of a lustful woman? And just look at these men: their eye reveals it – they know of nothing better on earth than to lie with a woman.  There is filth at the bottom of their souls; and it is worse if this filth still has something of the spirit in it! If only you had become perfect at least as animals! But to animals belongs innocence.  Do I exhort you to kill your senses? I exhort you to an innocence of the senses.  Do I exhort you to chastity? With some, chastity is a virtue, but with many it is almost a vice.  These people abstain, it is true: but the bitch Sensuality glares enviously out of all they do.  This restless beast follows them even into the heights of their virtue and the depths of their cold spirit.  And how nicely the bitch Sensuality knows how to beg for a piece of spirit, when a piece of flesh is denied her.  Do you love tragedies and all that is heartbreaking? But I mistrust your bitch Sensuality.  Your eyes are too cruel for me; you look upon sufferers lustfully.  Has your lasciviousness not merely disguised itself and called itself pity? And I offer you this parable: Not a few who sought to drive out their devil entered into the swine themselves.  Those to whom chastity is difficult should be dissuaded from it, lest it become the way to Hell – that is, to filth and lust of the soul.  Am I speaking of dirty things? That does not seem to me the worst I could do.  Not when truth is dirty, but when it is shallow, does the enlightened man dislike to wade into its waters.  Truly, there are those who are chaste from the very heart: they are more gentle of heart and they laugh more often and more heartily than you.  They laugh at chastity too, and ask: ‘What is chastity? ‘Is chastity not folly? But this folly came to us and not we to it.  ‘We offered this guest love and shelter: now it lives with us – let it stay as long as it wishes!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Passing By THUS , slowly making his way among many people and through divers towns, did Zarathustra return indirectly to his mountain and his cave.  And behold, on his way he came unawares to the gate of the great city; here, however, a frothing fool with hands outstretched sprang at him and blocked his path.  But this was the fool the people called ‘Zarathustra’s ape’: for he had learned from him something of the composition and syntax of language and perhaps also liked to borrow from his store of wisdom.  The fool, however, spoke thus to Zarathustra: O Zarathustra, here is the great city: here you have nothing to seek and everything to lose.  Why do you want to wade through this mud? Take pity on your feet! Rather spit upon the gate and – turn back! Here is the Hell for hermits’ thoughts: here great thoughts are boiled alive and cooked small.  Here all great emotions decay: here only little, dry emotions may rattle! Do you not smell already the slaughter-houses and cook-shops of the spirit? Does this city not reek of the fumes of slaughtered spirit? Do you not see the souls hanging like dirty, limp rags? – And they also make newspapers from these rags! Have you not heard how the spirit has here become a play with words? It vomits out repulsive verbal swill! – And they also make newspapers from this verbal swill.  They pursue one another and do not know where.  They inflame one another, and do not know why.  They rattle their tins, they jingle their gold.  They are cold and seek warmth in distilled waters; they are inflamed and seek coolness in frozen spirits; they are all ill and diseased with public opinion.  All lusts and vices are at home here; but there are virtuous people here, too, there are many adroit, useful virtues: Many adroit virtues with scribbling fingers and behinds hardened to sitting and waiting, blessed with little chest decorations and padded, rumpless daughters.  There is also much piety here and much devout spittle-licking and fawning before the God of Hosts.  Down ‘from on high’ drips the star and the gracious spittle; every starless breast longs to go up ‘on high’.  The moon has its court, and the court has its mooncalves: to all that comes from the court, however, do the paupers and all the adroit pauper-virtues pray.  ‘I serve, you serve, we serve’ – thus does all adroit virtue pray to the prince: so that the merited star may at last be fastened to the narrow breast.  But the moon still revolves around all that is earthly: so the prince, too, still revolves around what is most earthly of all: that, however, is the shopkeepers’ gold.  The God of Hosts is not the god of the golden ingots; the prince proposes, but the shopkeeper – disposes! By all that is luminous and strong and good in you, O Zarathustra! spit upon this city of shopkeepers and turn back! Here all blood flows foul and tepid and frothy through all veins: spit upon the great city that is the great rubbish pile where all the scum froths together! Spit upon the city of flattened souls and narrow breasts, of slant eyes and sticky fingers – upon the city of die importunate, the shameless, the ranters in writing and speech, the overheated ambitious: where everything rotten, disreputable, lustful, gloomy, overripe, ulcerous, conspiratorial festers together – spit upon the great city and turn back! But here Zarathustra interrupted the frothing fool and stopped his mouth.  Have done! (cried Zarathustra) Your speech and your kind have long disgusted me! Why did you live so long in the swamp that you had to become a frog and toad yourself? Does not foul, foaming swamp-blood now flow through your own veins, so that you have learned to quack and rail like this? Why did you not go into the forest? Or plough the earth? Is the sea not full of green islands? I despise your contempt; and since you warned me, why did you not warn yourself? My contempt and my bird of warning shall ascend from love alone; not from the swamp! They call you my ape, you frothing fool: but I call you my grunting pig – by grunting you are undoing even my praise of folly.  What, then, was it that started you grunting? That nobody had flattered you enough: therefore you sat down beside this filth, so that you might have cause for much grunting – so that you might have cause for much revenge ! For all your frothing, you vain fool, is revenge; I have divined you well! But your foolish teaching is harmful to me , even when you are right I And if Zarathustra’s teaching were a hundred times justified, you would still – use my teaching falsely! Thus spoke Zarathustra; and he looked at the great city, sighed and was long silent.  At length he spoke thus: This great city, and not only this fool, disgusts me.  In both there is nothing to make better, nothing to make worse.  Woe to this great city! And I wish I could see already the pillar of fire in which it will be consumed! For such pillars of fire must precede the great noontide.  Yet this has its time and its own destiny.  But I offer you in farewell this precept, you fool: Where one can no longer love, one should – pass by ! Thus spoke Zarathustra and passed by the fool and the great city.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of War and Warriors W E do not wish to be spared by our best enemies, nor by those whom we love from the very heart.  So let me tell you the truth! My brothers in war! I love you from the very heart, I am and have always been of your kind.  And I am also your best enemy.  So let me tell you the truth! I know the hatred and envy of your hearts.  You are not great enough not to know hatred and envy.  So be great enough not to be ashamed of them! And if you cannot be saints of knowledge, at least be its warriors.  They are the companions and forerunners of such sainthood.  I see many soldiers: if only I could see many warriors! What they wear is called uniform: may what they conceal with it not be uniform too! You should be such men as are always looking for an enemy – for your enemy.  And with some of you there is hate at first sight.  You should seek your enemy, you should wage your war – a war for your opinions.  And if your opinion is defeated, your honesty should still cry triumph over that! You should love peace as a means to new wars.  And the short peace more than the long.  I do not exhort you to work but to battle.  I do not exhort you to peace, but to victory.  May your work be a battle, may your peace be a victory! One can be silent and sit still only when one has arrow and bow: otherwise one babbles and quarrels.  May your peace be a victory! You say it is the good cause that hallows even war? I tell you: it is the good war that hallows every cause.  War and courage have done more great things than charity.  Not your pity but your bravery has saved the unfortunate up to now.  ‘What is good?’ you ask.  To be brave is good.  Let the little girls say: ‘To be good is to be what is pretty and at the same time touching.’ They call you heartless: but your heart is true, and I love the modesty of your kind-heartedness.  You feel ashamed of your flow, while others feel ashamed of their ebb.  Are you ugly? Very well, my brothers! Take the sublime about you, the mantle of the ugly! And when your soul grows great, it grows arrogant, and there is wickedness in your sublimity.  I know you.  In wickedness, the arrogant and the weak man meet.  But they misunderstand one another.  I know you.  You may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  You must be proud of your enemy: then the success of your enemy shall be your success too.  To rebel – that shows nobility in a slave.  Let your nobility show itself in obeying! Let even your commanding be an obeying! To a good warrior, ‘thou shalt’ sounds more agreeable than ‘I will’.  And everything that is dear to you, you should first have commanded to you.  Let your love towards life be love towards your highest hope: and let your highest hope be the highest idea of life! But you should let me commend to you your highest idea -and it is: Man is something that should be overcome.  Thus live your life of obedience and war! What good is long life? What warrior wants to be spared? I do not spare you, I love you from the very heart, my brothers in war! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Priests A ND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these words to them: Here are priests: and although they are my enemies, pass them by quietly and with sleeping swords! There are heroes even among them; many of them have suffered too much: so they want to make others suffer.  They are bad enemies: nothing is more revengeful than their humility.  And he who touches them is easily defiled.  But my blood is related to theirs; and I want to know my blood honoured even in theirs.  And when they had passed by, Zarathustra was assailed by a pain; and he had not struggled long with his pain when he began to speak thus: I pity these priests.  They go against my taste, too; but that means little to me since I am among men.  But I suffer and have suffered with them: they seem to me prisoners and marked men.  He whom they call Redeemer has cast them into bondage - Into the bondage of false values and false scriptures! Ah, that someone would redeem them from their Redeemer! Once, as the sea tossed them about, they thought they had landed upon an island; but behold, it was a sleeping monster! False values and false scriptures: they are the worst monsters for mortal men – fate sleeps and waits long within them.  But at last it comes and awakes and eats and devours all that have built their huts upon it.  Oh, just look at these huts that these priests have built themselves.  Churches they call their sweet-smelling caves! Oh this counterfeit light! oh this musty air I here, where the soul may not fly up to its height! On the contrary, their faith commands: ‘Up the steps on your knees, you sinners!’ Truly, I would rather see men still shameless than with the distorted eyes of their shame and devotion! Who created such caves and penitential steps? Was it not those who wanted to hide themselves and were ashamed before the clear sky? And only when the clear sky again looks through broken roofs and down upon grass and red poppies on broken walls – only then will I turn my heart again towards the places of this God.  They called God that which contradicted and harmed them: and truly, there was much that was heroic in their worship! And they knew no other way of loving their God than by nailing men to the Cross! They thought to live as corpses, they dressed their corpses in black; even in their speech I still smell the evil aroma of burial vaults.  And he who lives in their neighbourhood lives in the neighbourhood of black pools, from out of which the toad, that prophet of evil, sings its song with sweet melancholy.  They would have to sing better songs to make me believe in their Redeemer: his disciples would have to look more redeemed! I should like to see them naked: for beauty alone should preach penitence.  But whom could this disguised affliction persuade! Truly, their Redeemers themselves did not come from freedom and the seventh heaven of freedom! Truly, they themselves never trod upon the carpets of knowledge! The spirit of their Redeemers consisted of holes; but into every hole they had put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.  Their spirit was drowned in their pity, and when they swelled and overswelled with pity a great folly always swam to the top.  Zealously and with clamour they drove their herds over their bridge: as if there were only one bridge to the future! Truly, these shepherds, too, still belonged among the sheep! These shepherds had small intellects and spacious souls: but, my brothers, what small countries have even the most spacious souls been, up to now! They wrote letters of blood on the path they followed, and their folly taught that truth is proved by blood.  But blood is the worst witness of truth; blood poisons and transforms the purest teaching to delusion and hatred of the heart.  And if someone goes through fire for his teaching – what does that prove? Truly, it is more when one’s own teaching comes out of one’s own burning! Sultry heart and cold head: where these meet there arises the blusterer, the ‘Redeemer’.  Truly, there have been greater men and higher-born ones than those whom the people call Redeemer, those ravishing and overpowering blustering winds! And you, my brothers, must be redeemed by greater men than any Redeemer has been, if you would find the way to freedom! There has never yet been a Superman.  I have seen them both naked, the greatest and the smallest man.  They are still all-too-similar to one another.  Truly, I found even the greatest man – all-too-human! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Spirit of Gravity 1 M Y glib tongue – is of the people; I speak too coarsely and warmly for silky rabbits.  And my words sound even stranger to all inky fish and scribbling foxes.  My hand – is a fool’s hand: woe to all tables and walls and whatever has room left for fool’s scribbling, fool’s doodling! My foot – is a horse’s foot: with it I trot and trample up hill, down dale, hither and thither over the fields, and am the Devil’s own for joy when I am out at a gallop.  My stomach – is it perhaps an eagle’s stomach? For it likes lamb’s flesh best of all.  But it is certainly a bird’s stomach.  Nourished with innocent and few things, ready and impatient to fly, to fly away – that is my nature now: how should there not be something of the bird’s nature in it! And especially bird-like is that I am enemy to the Spirit of Gravity: and truly, mortal enemy, arch-enemy, born enemy! Oh where has my enmity not flown and strayed already! I could sing a song about that – and I will sing one, although I am alone in an empty house and have to sing it to my own ears.  There are other singers, to be sure, whose voices are softened, whose hands are eloquent, whose eyes are expressive, whose hearts are awakened, only when the house is full: I am not one of them.  2 He who will one day teach men to fly will have moved all boundary-stones; all boundary-stones will themselves fly into the air to him, he will baptize the earth anew – as ‘the weightless’.  The ostrich runs faster than any horse, but even he sticks his head heavily into heavy earth: that is what the man who cannot yet fly is like.  He calls earth and life heavy: and so will the Spirit of Gravity have it! But he who wants to become light and a bird must love himself – thus do I teach.  Not with the love of the sick and diseased, to be sure: for with them even self-love stinks! One must learn to love oneself with a sound and healthy love, so that one may endure it with oneself and not go roaming about – thus do I teach.  Such roaming about calls itself ‘love of one’s neighbour’: these words have been up to now the best for lying and dissembling, and especially for those who were oppressive to everybody.  And truly, to learn to love oneself is no commandment for today or for tomorrow.  Rather is this art the finest, subtlest, ultimate, and most patient of all.  For all his possessions are well concealed from the possessor; and of all treasure pits, one’s own is the last to be digged – the Spirit of Gravity is the cause of that.  Almost in the cradle are we presented with heavy words and values: this dowry calls itself’ Good’ and ‘Evil’.  For its sake we are forgiven for being alive.  And we suffer little children to come to us, to prevent them in good time from loving themselves: the Spirit of Gravity is the cause of that.  And we – we bear loyally what we have been given upon hard shoulders over rugged mountains! And when we sweat we are told: ‘Yes, life is hard to bear!’ But only man is hard to bear! That is because he bears too many foreign things upon his shoulders.  Like the camel, he kneels down and lets himself be well laden.  Especially the strong, weight-bearing man in whom dwell respect and awe: he has laden too many foreign heavy words and values upon himself – now life seems to him a desert! And truly I Many things that are one’s own are hard to bear, too! And much that is intrinsic in man is like the oyster, that is loathsome and slippery and hard to grasp – so that a noble shell with noble embellishments must intercede for it.  But one has to learn this art as well: to have a shell and a fair appearance and a prudent blindness! Again, it is deceptive about many things in man that many a shell is inferior and wretched and too much of a shell.  Much hidden goodness and power is never guessed at; the most exquisite dainties find no tasters! Women, or the most exquisite of them, know this: a little fatter, a little thinner – oh, how much fate lies in so little! Man is difficult to discover, most of all to himself; the spirit often tells lies about the soul.  The Spirit of Gravity is the cause of that.  But he has discovered himself who says: This is my good and evil: he has silenced thereby the mole and dwarf who says: ‘Good for all, evil for all.’ Truly, I dislike also those who call everything good and this world the best of all.  I call such people the all-contented.  All-contentedness that knows how to taste everything: that is not the best taste! I honour the obstinate, fastidious tongues and stomachs that have learned to say ‘I’ and ‘Yes’ and ‘No’.  But to chew and digest everything – that is to have a really swinish nature! Always to say Ye-a 32 – only the ass and those like him have learned that.  Deep yellow and burning red: that is to my taste – it mixes blood with all colours.  But he who whitewashes his house betrays to me a whitewashed soul.  One loves mummies, the other phantoms; and both alike enemy to all flesh and blood – oh, how both offend my taste! For I love blood.  And I do not want to stay and dwell where everyone spews and spits: that is now my taste – I would rather live among thieves and perjurers.  No one bears gold in his mouth.  More offensive to me, however, are all lickspittles; and the most offensive beast of a man I ever found I baptized Parasite: it would not love, yet wanted to live by love.  I call wretched all who have only one choice: to become an evil beast or an evil tamer of beasts: I would build no tabernacles among these men.  I also call wretched those who always have to wait – they offend my taste: all tax-collectors and shopkeepers and kings and other keepers of lands and shops.  Truly, I too have learned to wait, I have learned it from the very heart, but only to wait for myself .  And above all I have learned to stand and to walk and to run and to jump and to climb and to dance.  This, however, is my teaching: He who wants to learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and to walk and to run and to climb and to dance – you cannot learn to fly by flying! With rope-ladders I learned to climb to many a window, with agile legs I climbed up high masts: to sit upon high masts of knowledge seemed to me no small happiness – to flicker like little flames upon high masts: a little light, to be sure, but yet a great comfort to castaway sailors and the shipwrecked! I came to my truth by diverse paths and in diverse ways: it was not upon a single ladder that I climbed to the height where my eyes survey my distances.  And I have asked the way only unwillingly – that has always offended my taste! I have rather questioned and attempted the ways themselves.  All my progress has been an attempting and a questioning – and truly, one has to learn how to answer such questioning! That however – is to my taste: not good taste, not bad taste, but my taste, which I no longer conceal and of which I am no longer ashamed.  ‘This – is now my way: where is yours?’ Thus I answered those who asked me ‘the way’.  For the way – does not exist! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Ugliest Man A ND again Zarathustra’s feet ran through forests and mountains, and his eyes sought and sought, but him they desired to see, the great sufferer and crier of distress, was nowhere to be seen.  All the time he was on his way, however, he rejoiced in his heart and was thankful.  ‘What good things this day has given me,’ he said, ‘as recompense for having begun so badly! What strange discoursers I have found! ‘Now I will long chew their words as if they were fine corn; my teeth shall grind and crunch them small, until they flow into my soul like milk!’ But when the path again rounded a rock, all at once the scenery changed, and Zarathustra stepped into a kingdom of death.  Here black and red cliffs projected up: no grass, no tree, no cry of birds.  For it was a valley which all beasts avoided, even the beasts of prey; except that a kind of ugly, thick, green serpent, when it grew old, came here to die.  Therefore the shepherds called this valley ‘Serpent’s Death’.  Zarathustra, however, was plunged into dark recollections, for it seemed to him as if he had stood in this valley once before.  And many heavy things settled upon his mind: so that he went slowly and ever slower and at last stopped.  Then, however, as he opened his eyes, he saw something sitting on the pathway, shaped like a man and yet hardly like a man, something unutterable.  And all at once Zarathustra was overcome by the great shame of having beheld such a thing: blushing to his white hair, he turned his glance away and lifted his foot to leave this evil spot.  But then the dead wilderness resounded: for from the ground issued a gurgling, rasping sound such as water makes in stopped-up water-pipes at night; and at last a human voice and human speech emerged from it: it sounded thus: ‘Zarathustra! Zarathustra! Read my riddle! Speak, speak! What is the revenge on the witness? ‘I entice you back, here is slippery ice! Take care, take care that your pride does not here break its legs! ‘You think yourself wise, proud Zarathustra! So read the riddle, you hard nut-cracker – the riddle that I am! So speak: who am I?’ But when Zarathustra had heard these words, what do you think then happened to his soul? Pity overcame him ; and all at once he sank down, like an oak tree that has long withstood many woodchoppers, heavily, suddenly, to the terror even of those who wanted to fell it.  But at once he arose from the ground and his countenance grew stern.  ‘I know you well,’ he said in a brazen voice: ‘you are the murderer of God ! Let me go.  ‘You could not endure him who saw you – who saw you unblinking and through and through, you ugliest man! You took revenge upon this witness!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra and made to depart; but the unutterable creature grasped for a corner of his garment and began again to gurgle and grope for speech.  ‘Stay!’ he said at last, ‘stay! Do not go by! I have divined what axe it was that struck you to earth: Hail to you, O Zarathustra, that you are standing again! ‘You have divined, I know it well, how he feels who killed God – how the murderer of God feels.  Stay I Sit beside me; it is not to no purpose.  ‘To whom did I intend to go if not to you? Stay, sit down! But do not look at me! Honour thus – my ugliness! ‘They persecute me: now you are my last refuge.  Not with their hatred, not with their henchmen – oh, I would mock such persecution, I would be proud and glad of it! ‘Has not all success hitherto been with the well-persecuted? And he who persecutes well easily learns to follow 45 – for he is already – at the heels of others.  But it is their pity , ‘it is their pity from which I flee and flee to you.  O Zarathustra, my last refuge, protect me; you, the only one who can divine me: ‘you have divined how he feels who has killed him .  Stay! And if you will go, impatient man, do not go the way I came.  That way is bad.  ‘Are you angry with me because I have mangled language too long? Because I have advised you? But know: it is I, the ugliest man, ‘who also have the biggest, heaviest feet.  Where I have gone, the way is bad.  I tread all roads to death and to destruction.  ‘But that you went past me, silent; that you blushed, I saw it well: by that I knew you for Zarathustra.  ‘Anyone else would have thrown me his alms, his pity, in glance and speech.  But for that – I am not enough of a beggar, you have divined that – ‘for that I am too rich , rich in big things, in fearsome things, in the ugliest things, in the most unutterable things! Your shame, O Zarathustra, honoured me! ‘I escaped with difficulty from the importunate crowd of those who pity, that I might find the only one who today teaches “Pity is importunate” – you, O Zarathustra! ‘ – be it the pity of a god, be it human pity: pity is contrary to modesty.  And unwillingness to help may be nobler than that virtue which comes running with help.  ‘That however, pity, is called virtue itself with all little people – they lack reverence for great misfortune, great ugliness, great failure.  ‘I look beyond all these, as a dog looks over the backs of swarming flocks of sheep.  They are little, well-meaning, well-woolled, colourless people.  ‘As a heron looks contemptuously over shallow ponds, with head thrown back: so do I look over the swarm of colourless little waves and wills and souls.  ‘Too long have they been allowed right, these little people: thus at last they have been allowed power, too – now they teach: “Only that is good which little people call good.” ‘And “truth” today is what the preacher said who himself sprang from them, that strange saint and advocate of the little people who testified of himself “I – am the truth”.  ‘This immodest man has long made the cock’s comb of the little people rise up in pride – he who taught no small error when he taught “I – am the truth”.  ‘Was an immodest man ever answered more politely? But you, O Zarathustra, passed him by and said: “No! No! Thrice No!” ‘You warned against his error, as the first to do so, you warned against pity – no one else, only you and those of your kind.  ‘You are ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and truly, when you say “A great cloud emerges from pity, take care mankind!” ‘When you teach “All creators are hard, all great love is beyond pity”: O Zarathustra, how well-read in weather-omens you seem to me! ‘You yourself, however – warn yourself too against your pity! For many are on their way to you, many suffering, doubting, despairing, drowning, freezing people – ‘I warn you too against myself.  You have read my best, my worst riddle, me myself, and what I have done.  I know the axe that fells you.  ‘But he – had to die: he looked with eyes that saw everything – he saw the depths and abysses of man, all man’s hidden disgrace and ugliness.  ‘His pity knew no shame: he crept into my dirtiest corners.  This most curious, most over-importunate, over-compassionate god had to die.  ‘He always saw me : I desired to take revenge on such a witness – or cease to live myself.  ‘The god who saw everything, even man : this god had to die! Man could not endure that such a witness should live.’ Thus spoke the ugliest man.  Zarathustra, however, rose and prepared to go: for he was chilled to his very marrow.  ‘You unutterable creature,’ he said, ‘you warned me against your road.  As thanks for that, I recommend you mine.  Behold, up yonder lies Zarathustra’s cave.  ‘My cave is big and deep and possesses many corners; there the best hidden man can find his hiding place.  And close by it are a hundred secret and slippery ways for creeping, fluttering, and jumping beasts.  ‘You outcast who cast yourself out, do you not wish to live among men and the pity of men? Very well, do as I do.  Thus you will also learn from me; only the doer learns.  ‘And first of all and above all speak with my animals! The proudest animal and the wisest animal – they may well be the proper counsellors for both of us!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra and went his way, even more thoughtfully and slowly than before: for he asked himself many things and did not easily know what to answer.  How poor is man! (he thought in his heart) how ugly, how croaking, how full of secret shame! They tell me that man loves himself: ah, how great must this self-love be! How much contempt is opposed to it! Even this man has loved himself as he has despised himself – he seems to me a great lover and a great despiser.  I have yet found no one who has despised himself more deeply: even that is height.  Alas, was he perhaps the Higher Man whose cry I heard? I love the great despisers.  Man, however, is something that must be overcome.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Friend ‘O NE is always one too many around me’ – thus speaks the hermit.  ‘Always once one – in the long run that makes two!’ I and Me are always too earnestly in conversation with one another: how could it be endured, if there were not a friend? For the hermit the friend is always the third person: the third person is the cork that prevents the conversation of the other two from sinking to the depths.  Alas, for all hermits there are too many depths.  That is why they long so much for a friend and for his heights.  Our faith in others betrays wherein we would dearly like to have faith in ourselves.  Our longing for a friend is our betrayer.  And often with our love we only want to leap over envy.  And often we attack and make an enemy in order to conceal that we are vulnerable to attack.  ‘At least be my enemy!’ – thus speaks the true reverence, that does not venture to ask for friendship.  If you want a friend, you must also be willing to wage war for him: and to wage war, you must be capable of being an enemy.  You should honour even the enemy in your friend.  Can you go near to your friend without going over to him? In your friend you should possess your best enemy.  Your heart should feel closest to him when you oppose him.  Do you wish to go naked before your friend? Is it in honour of your friend that you show yourself to him as you are? But he wishes you to the Devil for it! He who makes no secret of himself excites anger in others: that is how much reason you have to fear nakedness! If you were gods you could then be ashamed of your clothes! You cannot adorn yourself too well for your friend: for you should be to him an arrow and a longing for the Superman.  Have you ever watched your friend asleep – to discover what he looked like? Yet your friend’s face is something else beside.  It is your own face, in a rough and imperfect mirror.  Have you ever watched your friend asleep? Were you not startled to see what he looked like? O my friend, man is something that must be overcome.  The friend should be a master in conjecture and in keeping silence: you must not want to see everything.  Your dream should tell you what your friend does when awake.  May your pity be a conjecture: that you may first know if your friend wants pity.  Perhaps what he loves in you is the undimmed eye and the glance of eternity.  Let your pity for your friend conceal itself under a hard shell; you should break a tooth biting upon it.  Thus it will have delicacy and sweetness.  Are you pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to your friend? Many a one cannot deliver himself from his own chains and yet he is his friend’s deliverer.  Are you a slave? If so, you cannot be a friend.  Are you a tyrant? If so, you cannot have friends.  In woman, a slave and a tyrant have all too long been concealed.  For that reason, woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knows only love.  In a woman’s love is injustice and blindness towards all that she does not love.  And in the enlightened love of a woman, too, there is still the unexpected attack and lightning and night, along with the light.  Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women ate still cats and birds.  Or, at best, cows.  Woman is not yet capable of friendship.  But tell me, you men, which of you is yet capable of friendship? Oh your poverty, you men, and your avarice of soul! As much as you give to your friend I will give even to my enemy, and will not have grown poorer in doing so.  There is comradeship: may there be friendship! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Involuntary Bliss W ITH such riddles and bitterness in his heart did Zarathustra fare across the sea.  When he was four days’ journey from the Blissful Islands and from his friends, however, he had overcome all his pain – triumphantly and with firm feet he again accepted his destiny.  26 And then Zarathustra spoke thus to his rejoicing conscience: I am again alone and willingly so, alone with the pure sky and the open sea; and again it is afternoon around me.  It was afternoon when I once found my friends for the first time, it was afternoon, too, when I found them a second time – at the hour when all light grows stiller.  For whatever happiness that is still travelling between heaven and earth now seeks shelter in a luminous soul: with happiness all light has now grown stiller.  O afternoon of my life! Once my happiness, too, climbed down into the valley to seek a shelter: there it found these open, hospitable souls.  O afternoon of my life! What have I not given away that I might possess one thing: this living plantation of my thoughts and this dawn of my highest hope! Once the creator sought companions and children of his hope: and behold, it turned out that he could not find them, except he first create them himself.  Thus I am in the midst of my work, going to my children and turning from them: for the sake of his children must Zarathustra perfect himself.  For one loves from the very heart only one’s child and one’s work; and where there is great love of oneself, then it is a sign of pregnancy: thus have I found.  My children are still green in their first spring, standing close together and shaken in common by the winds, the trees of my garden and my best soil.  And truly! Where such trees stand together, there blissful islands are ! But one day I will uproot them and set each one up by itself, that it may learn solitude and defiance and foresight.  Then it shall stand by the sea, gnarled and twisted and with supple hardiness, a living lighthouse of unconquerable life.  Yonder, where storms plunge down into the sea and the mountain’s snout drinks water, there each of them shall one day keep its day and night watch, for its testing and recogniton.  It shall be tested and recognized, to see whether it is of my kind and my race – whether it is master of a protracted will, silent even when it speaks, and giving in such a way that in giving it takes – that it may one day be my companion and a fellow-creator and fellow-rejoicer of Zarathustra – such a one as inscribes my will upon my tablets: for the greater perfection of all things.  And for its sake, and for those like it, must I perfect myself : therefore I now avoid my happiness and offer myself to all unhappiness – for my ultimate testing and recognition.  And truly, it was time I went; and the wanderer’s shadow and the longest sojourn and the stillest hour – all told me: ‘It is high time!’ The wind blew to me through the keyhole and said: ‘Come!’ The door sprang cunningly open and said: ‘Go!’ But I lay fettered to love of my children: desire set this snare for me, desire for love, that I might become my children’s victim and lose myself through them.  To desire – that now means to me: to have lost myself.  I possess you, my children! In this possession all should be certainty and nothing desire.  But the sun of my love lay brooding upon me, Zarathustra stewed in his own juice – then shadows and doubts flew past me.  I hankered after frost and winter: ‘Oh that frost and winter would again make me crackle and crunch!’ I sighed: then icy mist arose from me.  My past broke open its graves, many a pain buried alive awoke: they had only been sleeping, concealed in winding sheets.  Thus in symbols everything called to me: ‘It is time!’ But I – did not hear: until at last my abyss stirred and my thought bit me.  Alas, abysmal thought that is my thought! When shall I find the strength to hear you boring and no longer tremble? My heart rises to my throat when I hear you boring I Even your silence threatens to choke me, you abysmal, silent thought! I have never yet dared to summon you up : it has been enough that I – carried you with me! I have not yet been strong enough for the ultimate lion’s arrogance and lion’s wantonness.  Your heaviness has always been fearful enough for me: but one day I shall find the strength and the lion’s voice to summon you up! When I have overcome myself in that, I will overcome myself in that which is greater; and a victory shall be the seal of my perfection! In the meantime, I travel on uncertain seas; smooth-tongued chance flatters me; I gaze forward and backward, still I see no end.  The hour of my last struggle has not yet arrived – or has it perhaps just arrived? Truly, sea and life around me gaze at me with insidious beauty! O afternoon of my life! O happiness before evening! O harbour in mid-sea! O peace in uncertainty! How I mistrust you all! Truly, I am mistrustful of your insidious beauty! I am like the lover who mistrusts all-too-velvety smiles.  As the jealous man thrusts his best beloved from him, tender even in his hardness – thus do I thrust this blissful hour from me.  Away with you, blissful hour! With you there came to me an involuntary bliss!1 stand here ready for my deepest pain – you came out of season! Away with you, blissful hour! Rather take shelter yonder – with my children! Hurry, and bless them before evening with my happiness! There evening already approaches: the sun is sinking.  Away – my happiness! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  And he waited all night for his unhappiness: but he waited in vain.  The night remained clear and still and happiness itself drew nearer and nearer to him.  Towards morning, however, Zarathustra laughed to his heart and said ironically: ‘Happiness runs after me.  That is because I do not run after women.  Happiness, however, is a woman.’ Thus Spoke Zarathustra Thus Spoke Zarathustra A BOOK FOR EVERYONE AND NO ONE TRANSLATED WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY R.  J.  Hollingdale PENGUIN BOOKS Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Pale Criminal Y OU do not intend to kill, you judges and sacrificers, before the beast has bowed its neck? Behold, the pale criminal has bowed his neck: from his eye speaks the great contempt.  ‘My Ego is something that should be overcome: my Ego is to me the great contempt of man’: that is what this eye says.  He judged himself – that was his supreme moment: do not let the exalted man relapse again into his lowly condition! There is no redemption for him who thus suffers from himself, except it be a quick death.  Your killing, you judges, should be a mercy and not a revenge.  And since you kill, see to it that you yourselves justify life! It is not sufficient that you should be reconciled with him you kill.  May your sorrow be love for the Superman: thus will you justify your continuing to live! You should say ‘enemy’, but not ‘miscreant’; you should say ‘invalid’, but not ‘scoundrel’; you should say ‘fool’, but not ‘sinner’.  And you, scarlet judge, if you would speak aloud all you have done in thought, everyone would cry: ‘Away with this filth and poisonous snake!’ But the thought is one thing, the deed is another, and another yet is the image of the deed.  The wheel of causality does not roll between them.  An image made this pale man pale.  He was equal to his deed when he did it: but he could not endure its image after it was done.  Now for evermore he saw himself as the perpetrator of one deed.  I call this madness: in him the exception has become the rule.  The chalk-line charmed the hen; the blow he struck charmed his simple mind – I call this madness after the deed.  Listen, you judges! There is another madness as well; and it comes before the deed.  Ah, you have not crept deep enough into this soul! Thus says the scarlet judge: ‘Why did this criminal murder? He wanted to steal.’ But I tell you: his soul wanted blood not booty: he thirsted for the joy of the knife! But his simple mind did not understand this madness and it persuaded him otherwise.  ‘What is the good of blood?’ it said.  ‘Will you not at least commit a theft too? Take a revenge?’ And he hearkened to his simple mind: its words lay like lead upon him – then he robbed as he murdered.  He did not want to be ashamed of his madness.  And now again the lead of his guilt lies upon him, and again his simple mind is so numb, so paralysed, so heavy.  If only he could shake his head his burden would roll off: but who can shake this head? What is this man? A heap of diseases that reach out into the world through the spirit: there they want to catch their prey.  What is this man? A knot of savage serpents that are seldom at peace among themselves – thus they go forth alone to seek prey in the world.  Behold this poor body! This poor soul interpreted to itself what this body suffered and desired – it interpreted it as lust for murder and greed for the joy of the knife.  The evil which is now evil overtakes him who now becomes sick: he wants to do harm with that which harms him.  But there have been other ages and another evil and good.  Once doubt and the will to Self were evil.  Then the invalid became heretic and witch: as heretic and witch he suffered and wanted to cause suffering.  But this will not enter your ears: you tell me it hurts your good people.  But what are your good people to me? Much about your good people moves me to disgust, and it is not their evil I mean.  How I wish they possessed a madness through which they could perish, like this pale criminal.  Truly, I wish their madness were called truth or loyalty or justice: but they possess their virtue in order to live long and in a miserable ease.  I am a railing beside the stream: he who can grasp me, let him grasp me! I am not, however, your crutch.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Sublime Men S TILL is the bottom of my sea: who could guess that it hides sportive monsters! Imperturbable is my depth: but it glitters with swimming riddles and laughter.  Today I saw a sublime man, a solemn man, a penitent of the spirit: oh, how my soul laughed at his ugliness! With upraised breast and in the attitude of a man drawing in breath: thus he stood there, the sublime man, and silent.  Hung with ugly truths, the booty of his hunt, and rich in torn clothes; many thorns, too, hung on him – but I saw no rose.  As yet he has not learned of laughter and beauty.  This huntsman returned gloomily from the forest of knowledge.  He returned home from the fight with wild beasts: but a wild beast still gazes out of his seriousness – a beast that has not been overcome! He stands there like a tiger about to spring; but I do not like these tense souls, my taste is hostile towards all these withdrawn men.  And do you tell me, friends, that there is no dispute over taste and tasting? But all life is dispute over taste and tasting! Taste: that is at the same time weight and scales and weigher; and woe to all living creatures that want to live without dispute over weight and scales and weigher! If he grew weary of his sublimity, this sublime man, only then would his beauty rise up – and only then will I taste him and find him tasty.  And only if he turns away from himself will he jump over his own shadow – and jump, in truth, into bis own sunlight.  He has sat all too long in the shadows, the cheeks of the penitent of the spirit have grown pale; he has almost starved on his expectations.  There is still contempt in his eye, and disgust lurks around his mouth.  He rests now, to be sure, but he has never yet lain down in the sunlight.  He should behave like the ox; and his happiness should smell of the earth and not of contempt for the earth.  I should like to see him as a white ox, snorting and bellowing as he goes before the plough: and his bellowing, too, should laud all earthly things! His countenance is still dark; his hand’s shadow plays upon it.  The sense of his eyes, too, is overshadowed.  His deed itself is still the shadow upon him: the hand darkens the doer.  18 He has still not overcome his deed.  To be sure, I love in him the neck of the ox: but now I want to see the eye of the angel, too.  He must unlearn his heroic will, too: he should be an exalted man and not only a sublime one – the ether itself should raise him up, the will-less one! He has tamed monsters, he has solved riddles: but he should also redeem his monsters and riddles, he should transform them into heavenly children.  His knowledge has not yet learned to smile and to be without jealousy; his gushing passion has not yet grown calm in beauty.  Truly, his longing should be silenced and immersed not in satiety but in beauty! The generosity of the magnanimous man should include gracefulness.  With his arm laid across his head: that is how the hero should rest, that is also how he should overcome his rest.  But it is precisely to the hero that beauty is the most difficult of all things.  Beauty is unattainable to all violent wills.  A little more, a little less: precisely that is much here, here that is the most of all.  To stand with relaxed muscles and unharnessed wills: that is the most difficult thing for all of you, you sublime men! When power grows gracious and descends into the visible: I call such descending beauty.  And I desire beauty from no one as much as I desire it from you, you man of power: may your goodness be your ultimate self-overpowering.  I believe you capable of any evil: therefore I desire of you the good.  In truth, I have often laughed at the weaklings who think themselves good because their claws are blunt! You should aspire to the virtue of the pillar: the higher it rises, the fairer and more graceful it grows, but inwardly harder and able to bear more weight.  Yes, you sublime man, you too shall one day be fair and hold the mirror before your own beauty.  Then your soul will shudder with divine desires; and there will be worship even in your vanity! This indeed is the secret of the soul: only when the hero has deserted the soul does there approach it in dreams – the superhero.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Famous Philosophers Y OU have served the people and the people’s superstitions, all you famous philosophers! – you have not served truth! And it is precisely for that reason that they paid you reverence.  And for that reason too they endured your disbelief, because it was a joke and a bypath for the people.  Thus the lord indulges his slaves and even enjoys their insolence.  But he who is hated by the people as a wolf is by the dogs: he is the free spirit, the enemy of fetters, the non-worshipper, the dweller in forests.  To hunt him from his hiding-place – the people always called that ‘having a sense of right’: they have always set their sharpest-toothed dogs upon him.  ‘For where the people are, truth is! Woe to him who seeks!’ That is how it has been from the beginning.  You sought to make the people justified in their reverence: that you called ‘will to truth’, you famous philosophers! And your heart always said to itself:’ I came from the people: God’s voice, too, came to me from them.’ You have always been obstinate and cunning, like the ass, as the people’s advocate.  And many a man of power who wanted to fare well with the people harnessed in front of his horses – a little ass, a famous philosopher.  And now I should like you to throw the lion-skin right off yourselves, you famous philosophers! The spotted skin of the beast of prey and the matted hair of the inquirer, the seeker, the overcomer! Ah, for me to learn to believe in your ‘genuineness’ you would first have to break your will to venerate.  Genuine – that is what I call him who goes into godforsaken deserts and has broken his venerating heart.  In the yellow sand and burned by the sun, perhaps he blinks thirstily at the islands filled with springs where living creatures rest beneath shady trees.  But his thirst does not persuade him to become like these comfortable creatures: for where there are oases there are also idols.  Hungered, violent, solitary, godless: that is how the lion-will wants to be.  Free from the happiness of serfs, redeemed from gods and worship, fearless and fearful, great and solitary: that is how the will of the genuine man is.  The genuine men, the free spirits, have always dwelt in the desert, as the lords of the desert; but in the towns dwell the well-fed famous philosophers – the draught animals.  For they always, as asses, pull – the people’s cart! Not that I am wroth with them for that: however, they are still servants and beasts in harness, even when they glitter with golden gear.  And they have often been good and praiseworthy servants.  For thus speaks virtue: ‘If you must be a servant, then seek him whom you can serve best! ‘The spirit and the virtue of your lord should thrive because you are his servant: thus you yourself will thrive with your lord’s spirit and virtue!’ And in truth, you famous philosophers, you servants of the people, you yourselves have thrived with the spirit and virtue of the people – and the people have thrived through you! It is to your honour I say this! But you are still of the people even in your virtue, of the people with their purblind eyes – of the people who do not know what spirit is! Spirit is the life that itself strikes into life: through its own torment it increases its own knowledge – did you know that before? And this is the spirit’s happiness: to be anointed and by tears consecrated as a sacrificial beast – did you know that before? And the blindness of the blind man and his seeking and groping shall yet bear witness to the power of the sun into which he gazed – did you know that before? And the enlightened man shall learn to build with mountains! It is a small thing for the spirit to move mountains – did you know that before? You know only the sparks of the spirit: but you do not see the anvil which the spirit is, nor the ferocity of its hammer! In truth, you do not know the spirit’s pride! But even less could you endure the spirit’s modesty, if it should ever deign to speak! And you have never yet dared to cast your spirit into a pit of snow: you are not hot enough for that! Thus you do not know the rapture of its coldness, either.  But you behave in all things in too familiar a way with the spirit; and you have often made of wisdom a poorhouse and hospital for bad poets.  You are no eagles: so neither do you know the spirit’s joy in terror.  And he who is not a bird shall not make his home above abysses.  You are tepid: but all deep knowledge flows cold.  The innermost wells of the spirit are ice-cold: a refreshment to hot hands and handlers.  You stand there respectable and stiff and with a straight back, you famous philosophers! – no strong wind or will propels you.  Have you never seen a sail faring over the sea, rounded and swelling and shuddering before the impetuosity of the wind? Like a sail, shuddering before the impetuosity of the spirit, my wisdom fares over the sea – my untamed wisdom! But you servants of the people, you famous philosophers – how could you fare with me? Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Last Supper F OR at this point the prophet interrupted the greeting of Zarathustra and his guests: he thrust himself forward like one with no time to lose, grasped Zarathustra’s hand and cried: ‘But Zarathustra! ‘One thing is more necessary than another, so you say yourself: very well, one thing is now more necessary to me than all others.  ‘A word in season: did you not invite me to a meal? And here are many who have travelled far.  You don’t intend to fob us off with speeches, do you? ‘Besides, you have all been thinking too much about freezing, drowning, choking, and other physical dangers: no one, however, has thought about my danger, that is, starving – ’ (Thus spoke the prophet; but when Zarathustra’s animals heard his words they ran off in terror.  For they saw that all they had brought home during the day would not suffice to cram this one philosopher.) ‘And dying of thirst,’ the prophet went on.  ‘And although I have heard water splashing here like speeches of wisdom, plenteous and unceasing: I – want wine ! ‘Not everyone is a born water-drinker, like Zarathustra.  Neither is water of any use to weary and drooping men: we ought to have wine – that alone brings sudden recovery and unpremeditated health!’ On this occasion, when the prophet desired wine, it happened that the king on the left, the silent one, also found speech for once.  ‘We have provided for wine,’ he said, ‘I and my brother, the king on the right: we have wine enough – a whole ass’s load of it.  So nothing is lacking but bread.’ ‘Bread?’ replied Zarathustra laughing.  ‘It is precisely bread that hermits do not have.  But man does not live by bread alone, but also by the flesh of good lambs, of which I have two.  ‘Let us quickly slaughter these and prepare them spicily with sage: that is how I like it.  And neither is there any lack of roots and fruits, fine enough even for gourmets and epicures; nor of nuts and other riddles that need cracking.  ‘Thus we shall very shortly partake of an excellent meal.  But whoever wants to eat with us must also lend a hand, even the kings.  For with Zarathustra even a king may be a cook.’ Everyone heartily agreed with this suggestion: except that the voluntary beggar exclaimed against flesh and wine and spices.  ‘Just listen to this glutton Zarathustra!’ he said jokingly: ‘does one take to caves and high mountains in order to partake of such meals? ‘To be sure, I now understand what he once taught us: “Praised be a moderate poverty!” and why he wants to abolish beggars.’ ‘Be of good cheer,’ Zarathustra replied to him, ‘as I am.  Stick to your usual custom, admirable man: grind your corn, drink your water, praise your own cooking: if only it makes you happy! ‘I am a law only for my own, I am not a law for all.  But he who belongs to me must be strong-limbed and nimble-footed, ‘merry in war and feasting, no mournful man, no dreamy fellow, ready for what is hardest as for a feast, healthy and whole.  ‘The best belongs to me and mine; and if we are not given it, we take it: the best food, the purest sky, the most robust thoughts, the fairest women!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra; the king on the right, however, replied: ‘Strange! Did one ever hear such clever things from the mouth of a philosopher? ‘And truly, it is the rarest thing to find a philosopher clever as well as wise, and not an ass.’ Thus spoke the king on the right and wondered; the ass, however, maliciously replied to his speech with ‘Ye-a.’ This, however, was the beginning of that long meal which is called ‘The Last Supper’ 50 in the history books.  And during that meal nothing was spoken of but the Higher Man .  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Greeting I T was only in the late afternoon that Zarathustra, after long, vain searching and roaming about, returned home to his cave.  But when he was opposite it, not twenty paces away, then occurred that which he now least expected: he heard again the great cry of distress .  And astonishing thing! this time it came from his own cave.  It was a protracted, manifold, strange cry, however, and Zarathustra clearly distinguished that it was composed of many voices: although, heard from a distance, it might sound like a cry from a single throat.  Thereupon, Zarathustra sprang towards his cave, and behold! what a spectacle awaited him after that concert! For all those whom he had passed by that day were seated together: the king on the right and the king on the left, the old sorcerer, the pope, the voluntary beggar, the shadow, the conscientious man of the spirit, the sorrowful prophet, and the ass; the ugliest man, however, had placed a crown upon his head and slung two purple sashes around him, for, like all the ugly, he loved to disguise and embellish himself.  But in the midst of this melancholy company stood Zarathustra’s eagle, agitated and with feathers ruffled, for he had been expected to answer too much for which his pride had no answer; the wise serpent, however, hung about its neck.  Zarathustra beheld all this with great amazement; then, however, he examined each of his guests with gentle curiosity, read what was in their souls, and was amazed anew.  In the meantime the assembled guests had risen from their seats and were respectfully waiting for Zarathustra to speak.  Zarathustra, however, spoke thus: You despairing men! You strange men! So was it your cry of distress I heard? And now I know, too, where to seek him whom I sought today in vain: the Higher Man – he sits in my own cave, the Higher Man! But why am I surprised! Have I myself not enticed him to me with honey offerings and cunning bird-calls of my happiness? But it seems to me you are ill adapted for company, you disturb one another’s hearts, you criers of distress, when you sit here together? First of all someone else must come, someone to make you laugh again, a good, cheerful Jack Pudding, a dancer and breeze and madcap, some old fool or other: – what do you think? But forgive me, you despairing men, that I speak before you such petty words, truly unworthy of such guests I But you do not guess what makes my heart wanton: you yourselves do it, and the sight of you, forgive me for it! For anyone beholding a man in despair grows brave.  To encourage a despairing man – anyone thinks himself strong enough for that.  To me have you given this strength – a goodly guest-gift, my exalted guests! Very well, do not be angry with me if I offer you something of mine.  This is my kingdom and my domain: but what is mine shall be yours for this evening and this night.  My animals shall serve you: let my cave be your resting place! No one shall despair at my hearth and home, I protect everyone from his wild animals in my preserve.  And that is the first thing I offer you: security! The second, however, is: my little finger.  And when you have that, take the whole hand, very well! and the heart in addition! Welcome to this place, welcome, my guests! Thus spoke Zarathustra and laughed with love and mischievousness.  After this greeting, his guests bowed themselves again and held a respectful silence; the king on the right, however, replied to him in their name.  By the manner in which you have offered us hand and greeting, O Zarathustra, do we recognize you as Zarathustra.  You have humbled yourself before us; you have almost injured our respect: but who could have humbled himself with such pride as you? That uplifts us ourselves, it is a refreshment to our eyes and hearts.  Just to see this would we climb higher mountains than this mountain.  For we have come as sightseers, we wanted to see what makes sad eyes bright.  And behold, already all our distressful crying is over.  Already our hearts and minds are opened and delighted.  Little is needed for our hearts to grow wanton.  Nothing more gladdening grows on earth, O Zarathustra, than an exalted, robust will: it is the earth’s fairest growth.  A whole landscape is refreshed by one such tree.  To the pine-tree, O Zarathustra, do I compare him who grows up like you: tall, silent, hard, alone, of the finest, supplest wood, magnificent – at last, however, reaching out with strong, green branches for its domain, asking bold questions of the winds and storms and whatever is at home in the heights, replying more boldly, a commander, a victor: oh who would not climb high mountains to behold such trees? The gloomy man, too, and the ill-constituted, refresh themselves at your tree, O Zarathustra; at your glance even the restless man grows secure and heals his heart.  And truly, many eyes today are raised to your mountain and your tree; a great longing has arisen, and many have learned to ask: Who is Zarathustra? And he into whose ear you have ever poured your song and your honey: all the hidden men, the hermits and hermit-couples, say all at once to their hearts: ‘Does Zarathustra still live? There is no longer any point in living, it is all one, everything is in vain: except we live with Zarathustra!’ ‘Why does he not come, he who has proclaimed himself so long?’ thus many ask.  ‘Has solitude devoured him? Or should we perhaps go to him?’ Now solitude itself yields and breaks apart and can no longer contain its dead.  The resurrected are to be seen everywhere.  Now the waves rise and rise around your mountain, O Zarathustra.  And however high your height may be, many must reach up to you: your boat shall not sit in die dry for much longer.  And that we despairing men have now come into your cave and are already no longer despairing: that is only a sign and omen that better men are on their way to you; for this itself is on its way to you, the last remnant of God among men, that is: all men possessed by great longing, great disgust, great satiety, all who do not want to live except they learn to hope again – except they learn from you, O Zarathustra, the great hope! Thus spoke the king on the right and grasped Zarathustra’s hand to kiss it; but Zarathustra resisted his adoration and stepped back startled, silently and abruptly, as if escaping into the far distance.  But after a short while he was again with his guests, regarded them with clear, questioning eyes, and said: My guests, you Higher Men, I will speak clearly and in plain German to you.  49 It is not for you that I have been waiting in these mountains.  (‘Clearly and in plain German? God help us!’ said the king on the left to himself at this point; ‘it is clear he does not know the good Germans, this wise man from the East! ‘But he means “uncouthly and in German” – very well! Nowadays that is not in quite the worst taste!’) Truly, you may all be Higher Men (Zarathustra went on): but for me – you are not high and strong enough.  For me, that is to say: for the inexorable that is silent within me but will not always be silent.  And if you belong to me, it is not as my right arm.  For he who himself stands on sick and tender legs, as you do, wants above all, whether he knows it or conceals it from himself: to be spared .  My arms and my legs, however, I do not spare, I do not spare my warriors : how, then, could you be fit for my warfare? With you I should still spoil every victory.  And some of you would give in simply on hearing the loud beating of my drums.  Neither are you handsome enough nor sufficiently wellborn for me.  I need pure, smooth mirrors for my teaching; upon your surface even my own reflection is distorted.  Many a burden, many a memory weighs down your shoulders; many an evil dwarf crouches in your corners.  And there is hidden mob in you, too.  And although you are high and of a higher type, much in you is crooked and malformed.  There is no smith in the world who could hammer you straight and into shape for me.  You are only bridges: may higher men than you step across upon you! You are steps: so do not be angry with him who climbs over you into bis height! From your seed there may one day grow for me a genuine son and perfect heir: but that is far ahead.  You yourselves are not those to whom my heritage and name belong.  It is not for you that I wait here in these mountains, it is not with you that I may go down for the last time.  You have come to me only as omens that higher men are already on their way to me, not men possessed of great longing, great disgust, great satiety, and that which you called the remnant of God, No! No! Thrice No! It is for others that I wait here in these mountains and I will not lift my foot from here without them, for higher, stronger, more victorious, more joyful men, such as are square-built in body and soul: laughing lions must come! O my guests, you strange men, have you yet heard nothing of my children? And that they are on their way to me? Speak to me of my gardens, of my Blissful Islands, of my beautiful new race, why do you not speak of them? This guest-gift do I beg of your love, that you speak to me of my children.  In them I am rich, for them I became poor: what have I not given, what would I not give, to possess one thing: these children, this living garden, these trees of life of my will and of my highest hope! Thus spoke Zarathustra and suddenly halted in his discourse: for his longing overcame him and he closed his eyes and mouth because his heart was so moved.  And all his guests, too, remained silent and stood still and dismayed: except that the old prophet started to make signs with his hands and his features.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra At Noontide A ND Zarathustra ran and ran and found no one else and was alone and found himself again and again and enjoyed and relished his solitude and thought of good things, for hours on end.  About the hour of noon, however, when the sun stood exactly over Zarathustra’s head, he passed by an old gnarled and crooked tree which was embraced around by the abundant love of a vine and hidden from itself: from the vine an abundance of yellow grapes hung down to the wanderer.  Then he felt a desire to relieve a little thirst and to pluck himself a grape; but when he had already extended his arm to do so, he felt an even greater desire to do something else: that is, to lie down beside the tree at the hour of perfect noon and sleep.  This Zarathustra did; and no sooner had he lain down upon the ground, in the stillness and secrecy of the multicoloured grass, than he forgot his little thirst and fell asleep.  For, as Zarathustra’s saying has it: One thing is more necessary than another.  Only his eyes remained open – for they were not wearied of seeing and admiring the tree and the love of the vine.  In falling asleep, however, Zarathustra spoke thus to his heart: Soft! Soft! Has the world not just become perfect? What has happened to me? As a delicate breeze, unseen, dances upon the smooth sea, light, light as a feather: thus – does sleep dance upon me.  My eyes it does not close, my soul it leaves awake.  It is light, truly I light as a feather.  It persuades me, I know not how; it inwardly touches me with a caressing hand, it compels me.  Yes, it compels me, so that my soul stretches itself out: how lengthy and weary my soul has grown, my strange soul! Has a seventh day’s evening come to it just at noontide? Has it wandered too long, blissfully, among good and ripe things? It stretches itself out, long, long – longer! it lies still, my strange soul.  It has tasted too many good things, this golden sadness oppresses it, it makes a wry mouth.  Like a ship that has entered its stillest bay – now it leans against the earth, weary of long voyages and uncertain seas.  Is the earth not more faithful? As such a ship lies against the shore, nestles against the shore – there it suffices for a spider to spin its thread out to it from the land.  No stronger ropes are needed.  As such a weary ship rests in the stillest bay: thus do I now rest dose to the earth, faithful, trusting, waiting, fastened to it by the finest threads.  Oh happiness! Oh happiness! Would you sing, O my soul? You lie in the grass.  But this is the secret, solemn hour when no shepherd plays his flute.  Take care! Hot noontide sleeps upon the fields.  Do not sing! Soft! The world is perfect.  Do not sing, you grass bird, O my soul! Do not even whisper! Just see – soft! old noontide sleeps, it moves its mouth: has it not just drunk a drop of happiness – an ancient brown drop of golden happiness, of golden wine? Something glides across it, its happiness laughs.  Thus – does a god laugh.  Soft! ‘Happiness; how little attains happiness!’ Thus I spoke once and thought myself wise.  But it was a blasphemy: I have learned that now.  Wise fools speak better.  Precisely the least thing, the gentlest, lightest, the rustling of a lizard, a breath, a moment, a twinkling of the eye – little makes up the quality of the best happiness.  Soft! What has happened to me? Listen! Has time flown away? Do I not fall? Have I not fallen – listen! into the well of eternity? What is happening to me? Still! Is it stinging me – alas – in the heart? In the heart! oh break, break, heart, after such happiness, after such stinging! What? Has the world not just become perfect? Round and ripe? Oh, golden round ring 47 – whither does it fly? Away, after it! Away! Soft – (and at this point Zarathustra stretched himself and felt that he was asleep).  Up! (he said to himself) up, sleeper! You noontide sleeper! Very well, come on, old legs I It is time and past time, you have still a good way to go.  You have slept your fill, how long? Half an eternity! Very well, come on, my old heart! For how long after such a sleep may you – wake your fill? (But then he fell asleep again, and his soul contradicted him and resisted and again lay down.) ‘Let me alone! Soft! Has the world not just become perfect? Oh perfect as a round golden ball!’ Get up (said Zarathustra), you little thief, you lazybones! 48 What! Still stretching, yawning, sighing, falling into deep wells? But who are you then, O my soul? (And at this point he started, for a ray of sunlight had glanced down from the sky on to his face.) O sky above me (he said, sighing, and sat upright), are you watching me? Are you listening to my strange soul? When will you drink this drop of dew that has fallen upon all earthly things – when will you drink this strange soul – when, well of eternity! serene and terrible noontide abyss! when will you drink my soul back into yourself? Thus spoke Zarathustra and raised himself from his bed beside the tree as from a strange intoxication: and behold, the sun was still standing straight above his head.  One might rightly gather from that, however, that Zarathustra had not been sleeping for long.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Higher Man 1 W HEN I went to men for the first time, I committed the folly of hermits, the great folly: I set myself in the market-place.  And when I spoke to everyone, I spoke to no one.  In the evening, however, tight-rope walkers and corpses were my companions; and I myself was almost a corpse.  With the new morning, however, came to me a new truth: then I learned to say: ‘What are the market-place and the mob and the mob’s confusion and the mob’s long ears to me!’ You Higher Men, learn this from me: In the market-place no one believes in Higher Men.  And if you want to speak there, very well, do so! But the mob blink and say: ‘We are all equal.’ ‘You Higher Men’ – thus the mob blink – ‘there are no Higher Men, we are all equal, man is but man, before God – we are all equal!’ Before God! But now this God has died.  And let us not be equal before the mob.  You Higher Men, depart from the market-place! 2 Before God! But now this God has died! You Higher Men, this God was your greatest danger.  Only since he has lain in the grave have you again been resurrected.  Only now does the great noontide come, only now does the Higher Man become – lord and master! Have you understood this saying, O my brothers? Are you terrified: do your hearts fail? Does the abyss here yawn for you? Does the hound of Hell here yelp at you? Very well! Come on, you Higher Men! Only now does the mountain of mankind’s future labour.  God has died: now we desire – that the Superman shall live.  3 The most cautious people ask today: ‘How may man still be preserved?’ Zarathustra, however, asks as the sole and first one to do so: ‘How shall man be overcome? ’ The Superman lies close to my heart, be is my paramount and sole concern – and not man: not the nearest, not the poorest, not the most suffering, not the best.  O my brothers, what I can love in man is that he is a going-across and a going-down.  And in you, too, there is much that makes me love and hope.  That you have despised, you Higher Men, that makes me hope.  For the great despisers are the great reverers.  That you have despaired, there is much to honour in that.  For you have not learned how to submit, you have not learned petty prudence.  For today the petty people have become lord and master: they all preach submission and acquiescence and prudence and diligence and consideration and the long et cetera of petty virtues.  What is womanish, what stems from slavishness and especially from the mob hotchpotch: that now wants to become master of mankind’s entire destiny – oh disgust! disgust! disgust! That questions and questions and never tires: ‘How may man preserve himself best, longest, most agreeably?’ With that – they are the masters of the present.  Overcome for me these masters of the present, O my brothers – these petty people: they are the Superman’s greatest danger! Overcome, you Higher Men, the petty virtues, the petty prudences, the sand-grain discretion, the ant-swarm inanity, miserable ease, the ‘happiness of the greatest number’! And rather despair than submit.  And truly, I love you because you do not know how to live today, you Higher Men! For thus do you – live best! 4 Do you possess courage, O my brothers? Are you stouthearted? Not courage in the presence of witnesses, but hermits’ and eagles’ courage, which not even a god observes any more? I do not call cold-spirited, mulish, blind, or intoxicated men stout-hearted.  He possesses heart who knows fear but masters fear; who sees the abyss, but sees it with pride .  He who sees the abyss, but with an eagle’s eyes – he who grasps the abyss with an eagle’s claws: he possesses courage.  5 ‘Man is evil’ – all the wisest men have told me that to comfort me.  Ah, if only it be true today! For evil is man’s best strength.  ‘Man must grow better and more evil’ – thus do I teach.  The most evil is necessary for the Superman’s best.  It may have been good for that preacher of the petty people to bear and suffer the sin of man.  I, however, rejoice in great sin as my great consolation .  But these things are not said for long ears.  Neither does every word belong in every mouth.  They are subtle, remote things: sheep’s hooves ought not to grasp for them! 6 You Higher Men, do you think I am here to put right what you have done badly? Or that I mean henceforth to make more comfortable beds for you sufferers? Or show you restless, erring, straying men new, easier footpaths? No! No! Thrice No! More and more, better and better men of your kind must perish – for life must be harder and harder for you.  Only thus, only thus does man grow to the height where the lightning can strike and shatter him: high enough for the lightning! My mind and longing go out to the few, the protracted, the remote things: what are your many, little, brief miseries to me! You have not yet suffered enough! For you suffer from yourselves, you have not yet suffered from man .  You would lie if you said otherwise! None of you suffer from what I have suffered.  7 It does not suffice me that the lightning no longer does harm.  I do not want to conduct it away: it shall learn – to work for me .  My wisdom has long collected itself like a cloud, it is growing stiller and darker.  Thus does every wisdom that shall one day give birth to lightnings.  I do not want to be light for these men of the present, or be called light by them.  These men – I want to blind: lightning of my wisdom! put out their eyes! 8 Do not will beyond your powers: there is an evil falsity about those who will beyond their powers.  Especially when they will great things! For they awaken mistrust of great things, these subtle fabricators and actors: until at last they are false to themselves, squint-eyed, whitewashed rottenness, cloaked with clever words, with pretended virtues, with glittering, false deeds.  Guard yourselves well against that, you Higher Men! For I count nothing more valuable and rare today than honesty.  Does this present not belong to the mob? The mob, however, does not know what is great or small, what is straight and honest: it is innocently crooked, it always lies.  9 Have a healthy mistrust today, you Higher Men, you stouthearted, open-hearted men! And keep your reasons secret! For this present belongs to the mob.  Who could overturn with reasons what the mob has once learned to believe without reasons? And in the market-place one convinces with gestures.  But reasons make the mob mistrustful.  And when truth has triumphed for once, then you have asked with healthy mistrust: ‘What mighty error has fought fork?’ Be on your guard, too, against the learned! They hate you: for they are unfruitful! They have cold, dried-up eyes, before which all birds lie stripped of their feathers.  They boast that they do not tell lies: but inability to lie is far from being love of truth.  Be on your guard I Freedom from fever is far from being knowledge! I do not believe frozen spirits.  He who cannot lie does not know what truth is.  10 If you want to rise high, use your own legs! Do not let yourselves be carried up, do not sit on the backs and heads of strangers! But did you mount horse? Do you now ride pell-mell up to your goal? Very well, my friend! But your lame foot also sits with you on your horse! When you reach your goal, when you jump from your horse: precisely upon your height you Higher Man, will you stumble! 11 You creators, you Higher Men! One is pregnant only with one’s own child.  Let nothing impose upon you, nothing persuade you! For who is your neighbour? And if you do things ‘for your neighbour’, still you do not create for him! Unlearn this ‘for’, you creators: your very virtue wants you to have nothing to do with ‘for’ and ‘for the sake of and ‘because’.  You should stop your ears to these false little words.  This ‘for one’s neighbour’ is the virtue only of petty people: there they say ‘birds of a feather’ and ‘one good turn deserves another’ – they have neither right to nor strength for your selfishness! The prudence and providence of pregnancy is in your selfishness! What no one has yet seen, the fruit: that is protected and indulged and nourished by your whole love.  Where your whole love is, with your child, there too is your whole virtue! Your work, your will is your ‘neighbour’: let no false values persuade you otherwise! 12 You creators, you Higher Men! Whoever has to give birth is sick; but whoever has given birth is unclean.  Ask the women: one does not give birth for pleasure.  The pain makes hens and poets cackle.  You creators, there is much in you that is unclean.  That is because you have to be mothers.  A new child: oh how much new filth has also entered the world I Go aside I And whoever has given birth should wash his soul clean! 13 Do not be virtuous beyond your powers I And do not ask anything improbable of yourselves! Follow in the footsteps of your fathers’ virtue! How would you climb high if the will of your fathers did not climb with you? But he who wants to be a first-born should see that he does not also become a last-born I And you should not pretend to be saints in those matters in which your fathers were vicious! He whose fathers passed their time with women, strong wine, and roast pork, what would it be if he demanded chastity of himself? It would be a piece of folly! Truly, I think it would be much for such a one to be the husband of one or two or three women.  And if he founded monasteries and wrote above the doors: ‘The way to holiness’, I should still say: What of it! it is another piece of folly! He has founded for himself a house of refuge and correction: much good may it do him I But I have no faith in it.  It is what one takes into solitude that grows there, the beast within included.  And so, many should be dissuaded from solitude.  Has there ever been anything filthier on earth than the saints of the desert? Not only the devil was loose around them – but the swine, too.  14 Timid, ashamed, awkward, like a tiger whose leap has failed: this is how I have often seen you slink aside, you Higher Men.  A throw you made had failed.  But what of that, you dice-throwers! You have not learned to play and mock as a man ought to play and mock! Are we not always seated at a great table for play and mockery? And if great things you attempted have turned out failures, does that mean you yourselves are – failures? And if you yourselves have turned out failures, does that mean – man is a failure? If man has turned out a failure, however: very well! come on! 15 The higher its type, the less often does a thing succeed.  You Higher Men here, are you not all – failures? Be of good courage, what does it matter! How much is still possible! Learn to laugh at yourselves as a man ought to laugh! And no wonder you have failed and half succeeded, you half-broken men! Does there not strive and struggle in you -mankind’s future ? Mankind’s most distant, most profound questions, his reaching to the furthest stars, his prodigious power: does all that not foam together in your pot? No wonder many a pot is shattered! Learn to laugh at yourselves, as a man ought to laugh.  You Higher Men, oh how much is still possible! And truly, how much has already succeeded! How rich this earth is in good little perfect things, in well-constituted things! Set good little perfect things around you, you Higher Men! Things whose golden ripeness heals the heart.  Perfect things teach hope.  16 What has been the greatest sin here on earth? Was it not the saying of him who said: ‘Woe to those who laugh!’ Did he himself find on earth no reason for laughter? If so, he sought badly.  Even a child could find reasons.  He – did not love sufficiently: otherwise he would also have loved us, the laughers I But he hated and jeered at us, he promised us wailing and gnashing of teeth.  Does one then straightway have to curse where one does not love? That – seems to me bad taste.  But that is what he did, this uncompromising man.  He sprang from the mob.  And he himself did not love sufficiently: otherwise he would not have been so angry that he was not loved.  Great love does not desire love – it desires more.  Avoid all such uncompromising men! They are a poor, sick type, a mob type: they look upon this life with an ill will, they have an evil eye for this earth.  Avoid all such uncompromising men! They have heavy feet and sultry hearts – they do not know how to dance.  How could the earth be light to such men! 17 All good things approach their goal crookedly.  Like cats they arch their backs, they purr inwardly at their approaching happiness – all good things laugh.  His step betrays whether a man is stepping along his own path: so watch me walk! But he who approaches his goal, dances.  And truly, I have not become a statue, I do not stand here stiff, stumpy, stony, a pillar; I love to run fast.  And although there are swamps and thick afflictions on earth, he who has light feet runs even across mud and dances as upon swept ice.  Lift up your hearts, my brothers, high, higher! And do not forget your legs I Lift up your legs, too, you fine dancers: and better still, stand on your heads! 18 This laugher’s crown, this rose-wreath crown: I myself have set this crown on my head, I myself have canonized my laughter.  I have found no other strong enough for it today.  Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light, who beckons with his wings, ready for flight, beckoning to all birds, prepared and ready, blissfully light-hearted: Zarathustra the prophet, Zarathustra the laughing prophet, no impatient nor uncompromising man, one who loves jumping and escapades; 51 I myself have set this crown on my head! 19 Lift up your hearts, my brothers, high! higher! And do not forget your legs! Lift up your legs, too, you fine dancers: and better still, stand on your heads! There are beasts who are heavy-footed even in happiness, there are those who are clumsy-footed from birth.  They exert themselves strangely, like an elephant trying to stand on its head.  But better to be foolish with happiness than foolish with misfortune, better to dance clumsily than to walk lamely.  So learn from me my wisdom: even the worst thing has two good sides, even the worst thing has good dancing legs: so learn, you Higher Men, how to stand on your own proper legs! So unlearn trumpeting of affliction and all mob-sorrowfulness! Oh how sad the Jack Puddings of the mob seem to me at present! This present, however, belongs to the mob.  20 Be like the wind when it rushes forth from its mountain caves: it will dance to its own pipe, the seas tremble and leap under its footsteps.  That which gives wings to asses and milks lionesses, all praise to that unruly spirit that comes to all the present and all the mob like a storm-wind, – that is enemy to all thistle-heads and prying noses and to all withered leaves and weeds: all praise to that wild, good, free storm-spirit that dances upon swamps and afflictions as upon meadows! That hates the wasted dogs of the mob and all the ill-constituted brood of gloom: all praise to this spirit of all free spirits, the laughing storm that blows dust in the eyes of all the dim-sighted and ulcerated.  You Higher Men, the worst about you is: none of you has learned to dance as a man ought to dance – to dance beyond yourselves! What does it matter that you are failures! How much is still possible! So learn to laugh beyond yourselves! Lift up your hearts, you fine dancers, high! higher! and do not forget to laugh well! This laugher’s crown, this rose-wreath crown: to you, my brothers, do I throw this crown! I have canonized laughter; you Higher Men, learn – to laugh! Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Night Song I T is night: now do all leaping fountains speak louder.  And my soul too is a leaping fountain.  It is night: only now do all songs of lovers awaken.  And my soul too is the song of a lover.  Something unquenched, unquenchable, is in me, that wants to speak out.  A craving for love is in me, that itself speaks the language of love.  Light am I: ah, that I were night! But this is my solitude, that I am girded round with light.  Ah, that I were dark and obscure! How I would suck at the breasts of light! And I should bless you, little sparkling stars and glowworms above! – and be happy in your gifts of light.  But I live in my own light, I drink back into myself the flames that break from me.  I do not know the joy of the receiver; and I have often dreamed that stealing must be more blessed than receiving.  It is my poverty that my hand never rests from giving; it is my envy that I see expectant eyes and illumined nights of desire.  Oh wretchedness of all givers! Oh eclipse of my sun! Oh craving for desire! Oh ravenous hunger in satiety! They take from me: but do I yet touch their souls? A gulf stands between giving and receiving; and the smallest gulf must be bridged at last.  A hunger grows from out of my beauty: I should like to rob those to whom I give – thus do I hunger after wickedness.  Withdrawing my hand when another hand already reaches out to it; hesitating, like the waterfall that hesitates even in its plunge – thus do I hunger after wickedness.  Such vengeance does my abundance concoct: such spite wells from my solitude.  My joy in giving died in giving, my virtue grew weary of itself through its abundance! The danger for him who always gives, is that he may lose his shame; the hand and heart of him who distributes grow callous through sheer distributing.  My eye no longer overflows with the shame of suppliants; my hand has become too hard for the trembling of hands that have been filled.  Where have the tears of my eye and the bloom of my heart gone? Oh solitude of all givers! Oh silence of all light-givers! Many suns circle in empty space: to all that is dark they speak with their light – to me they are silent.  Oh, this is the enmity of light towards what gives light: unpitying it travels its way.  Unjust towards the light-giver in its inmost heart, cold towards suns – thus travels every sun.  Like a storm the suns fly along their courses; that is their travelling.  They follow their inexorable will; that is their coldness.  Oh, it is only you, obscure, dark ones, who extract warmth from light-givers! Oh, only you drink milk and comfort from the udders of light! Ah, ice is around me, my hand is burned with ice! Ah, thirst is in me, which yearns after your thirst! It is night: ah, that I must be light! And thirst for the things of night! And solitude! It is night: now my longing breaks from me like a well-spring – I long for speech.  It is night: now do all leaping fountains speak louder.  And my soul too is a leaping fountain.  It is night: only now do all songs of lovers awaken.  And my soul too is the song of a lover.  Thus sang Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Self-Overcoming W HAT urges you on and arouses your ardour, you wisest of men, do you call it ‘will to truth’? Will to the conceivability of all being: that is what I call your will! You first want to make all being conceivable: for, with a healthy mistrust, you doubt whether it is in fact conceivable.  But it must bend and accommodate itself to you! Thus will your will have it.  It must become smooth and subject to the mind as the mind’s mirror and reflection.  That is your entire will, you wisest men; it is a will to power; and that is so even when you talk of good and evil and of the assessment of values.  You want to create the world before which you can kneel: this is your ultimate hope and intoxication.  The ignorant, to be sure, the people – they are like a river down which a boat swims: and in the boat, solemn and disguised, sit the assessments of value.  You put your will and your values upon the river of becoming; what the people believe to be good and evil betrays to me an ancient will to power.  It was you, wisest men, who put such passengers in this boat and gave them splendour and proud names – you and your ruling will! Now the river bears your boat along: it has to bear it.  It is of small account if the breaking wave foams and angrily opposes its keel! It is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and evil, you wisest men, it is that will itself, the will to power, the unexhausted, procreating life-will.  But that you may understand my teaching about good and evil, I shall relate to you my teaching about life and about the nature of all living creatures.  I have followed the living creature, I have followed the greatest and the smallest paths, that I might understand its nature.  I caught its glance in a hundredfold mirror when its mouth was closed, that its eye might speak to me.  And its eye did speak to me.  But wherever I found living creatures, there too I heard the language of obedience.  All living creatures are obeying creatures.  And this is the second thing: he who cannot obey himself will be commanded.  That is the nature of living creatures.  But this is the third thing I heard: that commanding is more difficult than obeying.  And not only because the commander bears the burden of all who obey, and that this burden can easily crush him.  In all commanding there appeared to me to be an experiment and a risk: and the living creature always risks himself when he commands.  Yes, even when he commands himself: then also must he make amends for his commanding.  He must become judge and avenger and victim of his own law.  How has this come about? thus I asked myself.  What persuades the living creature to obey and to command and to practise obedience even in commanding? Listen now to my teaching, you wisest men! Test in earnest whether I have crept into the heart of life itself and down to the roots of its heart! Where I found a living creature, there I found will to power; and even in the will of the servant I found the will to be master.  The will of the weaker persuades it to serve the stronger; its will wants to be master over those weaker still: this delight alone it is unwilling to forgo.  And as the lesser surrenders to the greater, that it may have delight and power over the least of all, so the greatest, too, surrenders and for the sake of power stakes – life.  The devotion of the greatest is to encounter risk and danger and play dice for death.  And where sacrifice and service and loving glances are, there too is will to be master.  There the weaker steals by secret paths into the castle and even into the heart of the more powerful – and steals the power.  And life itself told me this secret: ‘Behold,’ it said, ‘I am that which must overcome itself again and again .  ‘To be sure, you call it will to procreate or impulse towards a goal, towards the higher, more distant, more manifold: but all this is one and one secret.  ‘I would rather perish than renounce this one thing; and truly, where there is perishing and the falling of leaves, behold, there life sacrifices itself – for the sake of power! ‘That I have to be struggle and becoming and goal and conflict of goals: ah, he who divines my will surely divines, too, along what crooked paths it has to go! ‘Whatever I create and however much I love it – soon I have to oppose it and my love: thus will my will have it.  ‘And you too, enlightened man, are only a path and footstep of my will: truly, my will to power walks with the feet of your will to truth! ‘He who shot the doctrine of “will to existence” at truth certainly did not hit the truth: this will – does not exist! ‘For what does not exist cannot will; but that which is in existence, how could it still want to come into existence? ‘Only where life is, there is also will: not will to life, but – so I teach you – will to power! ‘The living creature values many things higher than life itself; yet out of this evaluation itself speaks – the will to power!’ Thus life once taught me: and with this teaching do I solve the riddle of your hearts, you wisest men.  Truly, I say to you: Unchanging good and evil does not exist! From out of themselves they must overcome themselves again and again.  You exert power with your values and doctrines of good and evil, you assessors of values; and this is your hidden love and the glittering, trembling, and overflowing of your souls.  But a mightier power and a new overcoming grow from out your values: egg and egg-shell break against them.  And he who has to be a creator in good and evil, truly, has first to be a destroyer and break values.  Thus the greatest evil belongs with the greatest good: this, however, is the creative good.  Let us speak of this, you wisest men, even if it is a bad thing.  To be silent is worse; all suppressed truths become poisonous.  And let everything that can break upon our truths – break! There is many a house still to build! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Reading and Writing O F all writings I love only that which is written with blood.  Write with blood: and you will discover that blood is spirit.  It is not an easy thing to understand unfamiliar blood: I hate the reading idler.  He who knows the reader, does nothing further for the reader.  Another century of readers – and spirit itself will stink.  That everyone can learn to read will ruin in the long run not only writing, but thinking too.  Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it is even becoming mob.  He who writes in blood and aphorisms does not want to be read, he wants to be learned by heart.  In the mountains the shortest route is from peak to peak, but for that you must have long legs.  Aphorisms should be peaks, and those to whom they are spoken should be big and tall of stature.  The air thin and pure, danger near, and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: these things suit one another.  I want hobgoblins around me, for I am courageous.  Courage that scares away phantoms makes hobgoblins for itself – courage wants to laugh.  I no longer feel as you do: this cloud which I see under me, this blackness and heaviness at which I laugh – precisely this is your thunder-cloud.  You look up when you desire to be exalted.  And I look down, because I am exalted.  Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? He who climbs upon the highest mountains laughs at all tragedies, real or imaginary.  Untroubled, scornful, outrageous – that is how wisdom wants us to be: she is a woman and never loves anyone but a warrior.  You tell me: ‘Life is hard to bear.’ But if it were otherwise why should you have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening? Life is hard to bear: but do not pretend to be so tender! We are all of us pretty fine asses and assesses of burden! What have we in common with the rosebud, which trembles because a drop of dew is lying upon it? It is true: we love life, not because we are used to living but because we are used to loving.  There is always a certain madness in love.  But also there is always a certain method in madness.  And to me too, who love life, it seems that butterflies and soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them among men, know most about happiness.  To see these light, foolish, dainty, affecting little souls flutter about – that moves Zarathustra to tears and to song.  I should believe only in a God who understood how to dance.  And when I beheld my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: it was the Spirit of Gravity – through him all things are ruined.  One does not kill by anger but by laughter.  Come, let us kill the Spirit of Gravity! I have learned to walk: since then I have run.  I have learned to fly: since then I do not have to be pushed in order to move.  Now I am nimble, now I fly, now I see myself under myself, now a god dances within me.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.

But Zarathustra was silent for two days and was cold and deaf for sorrow, so that he responded neither to looks nor to questions.  But on the evening of the second day he opened his ears again, although he still remained silent: for there were many strange and dangerous things to hear on this ship, which had come from afar and had yet further to go.  Zarathustra, however, was a friend to all who take long journeys and do not want to live without danger.  And behold! in listening his tongue was loosened, and the ice of his heart broke: then he started to speak thus: To you, the bold venturers and adventurers and whoever has embarked with cunning sails upon dreadful seas, to you who are intoxicated by riddles, who take pleasure in twilight, whose soul is lured with flutes to every treacherous abyss – for you do not desire to feel for a rope with cowardly hand; and where you can guess you hate to calculate – to you alone do I tell this riddle that I saw – the vision of the most solitary man.  Lately I walked gloomily through a deathly-grey twilight, gloomily and sternly with compressed lips.  Not only one sun had gone down for me.  A path that mounted defiantly through boulders and rubble, a wicked, solitary path that bush or plant no longer cheered: a mountain path crunched under my foot’s defiance.  Striding mute over the mocking clatter of pebbles, trampling the stones that made it slip: thus my foot with effort forced itself upward.  Upward – despite the spirit that drew it downward, drew it towards the abyss, the Spirit of Gravity, my devil and archenemy.  Upward – although he sat upon me, half dwarf, half mole; crippled, crippling; pouring lead-drops into my ear, leaden thoughts into my brain.  ‘O Zarathustra,’ he said mockingly, syllable by syllable, ‘you stone of wisdom! You have thrown yourself high, but every stone that is thrown must – fall! ‘O Zarathustra, you stone of wisdom, you projectile, you star-destroyer! You have thrown yourself thus high, but every stone that is thrown – must fall! ‘Condemned by yourself and to your own stone-throwing: O Zarathustra, far indeed have you thrown your stone, but it will fall back upon you !’ Thereupon the dwarf fell silent; and he long continued so.  But his silence oppressed me; and to be thus in company is truly more lonely than to be alone! I climbed, I climbed, I dreamed, I thought, but everything oppressed me.  I was like a sick man wearied by his sore torment and reawakened from sleep by a worse dream.  But there is something in me that I call courage: it has always destroyed every discouragement in me.  This courage at last bade me stop and say: ‘Dwarf! You! Or I!’ For courage is the best destroyer – courage that attacks : for in every attack there is a triumphant shout.  Man, however, is the most courageous animal: with his courage he has overcome every animal.  With a triumphant shout he has even overcome every pain; human pain, however, is the deepest pain.  Courage also destroys giddiness at abysses: and where does man not stand at an abyss? Is seeing itself not – seeing abysses? Courage is the best destroyer: courage also destroys pity.  Pity, however, is the deepest abyss: as deeply as man looks into life, so deeply does he look also into suffering.  Courage, however, is the best destroyer, courage that attacks: it destroys even death, for it says: ‘Was that life? Well then! Once more!’ But there is a great triumphant shout in such a saying.  He who has ears to hear, let him hear.  2 ‘Stop, dwarf!’ I said.  ‘I! Or you! But I am the stronger of us two – you do not know my abysmal thought! That thought – you could not endure!’ Then something occurred which lightened me: for the dwarf jumped from my shoulder, the inquisitive dwarf! And he squatted down upon a stone in front of me.  But a gateway stood just where we had halted.  ‘Behold this gateway, dwarf!’ I went on: ‘it has two aspects.  Two paths come together here: no one has ever reached their end.  ‘This long lane behind us: it goes on for an eternity.  And that long lane ahead of us – that is another eternity.  ‘They are in opposition to one another, these paths; they abut on one another: and it is here at this gateway that they come together.  The name of the gateway is written above it: “Moment”.  ‘But if one were to follow them further and ever further and further: do you think, dwarf, that these paths would be in eternal opposition?’ ‘Everything straight lies,’ murmured the dwarf disdainfully.  ‘All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.’ ‘Spirit of Gravity!’ I said angrily, ‘do not treat this too lightly! Or I shall leave you squatting where you are, Lame-foot – and I have carried you high ! ‘Behold this moment!’ I went on.  ‘From this gateway Moment a long, eternal lane runs back : an eternity lies behind us.  ‘Must not all things that can run have already run along this lane? Must not all things that can happen have already happened, been done, run past? ‘And if all things have been here before: what do you think of this moment, dwarf? Must not this gateway, too, have been here – before? ‘And are not all things bound fast together in such a way that this moment draws after it all future things? Therefore – draws itself too? ‘For all things that can run must also run once again forward along this long lane.  ‘And this slow spider that creeps along in the moonlight, and this moonlight itself, and I and you at this gateway whispering together, whispering of eternal things – must we not all have been here before? ‘ – and must we not return and run down that other lane out before us, down that long, terrible lane – must we not return eternally?’ Thus I spoke, and I spoke more and more softly: for I was afraid of my own thoughts and reservations.  Then, suddenly, I heard a dog bowling nearby.  Had I ever heard a dog howling in that way? My thoughts ran back.  Yes! When I was a child, in my most distant childhood: – then I heard a dog howling in that way.  And I saw it, too, bristling, its head raised, trembling in the stillest midnight, when even dogs believe in ghosts: – so that it moved me to pity.  For the full moon had just gone over the house, silent as death, it had just stopped still, a round glow, still upon the flat roof as if upon a forbidden place: that was what had terrified the dog: for dogs believe in thieves and ghosts.  And when I heard such howling again, it moved me to pity again.  Where had the dwarf now gone? And the gateway? And the spider? And all the whispering? Had I been dreaming? Had I awoken? All at once I was standing between wild cliffs, alone, desolate in the most desolate moonlight.  But there a man was lying! And there! The dog, leaping, bristling, whining; then it saw me coming – then it howled again, then it cried out – had I ever heard a dog cry so for help? 25 And truly, I had never seen the like of what I then saw.  I saw a young shepherd writhing, choking, convulsed, his face distorted; and a heavy, black snake was hanging out of his mouth.  Had I ever seen so much disgust and pallid horror on a face? Had he, perhaps, been asleep? Then the snake had crawled into his throat – and there it had bitten itself fast.  My hands tugged and tugged at the snake – in vain! they could not tug the snake out of the shepherd’s throat.  Then a voice cried from me: ‘Bite! Bite! ‘Its head off! Bite!’ – thus a voice cried from me, my horror, my hate, my disgust, my pity, all my good and evil cried out of me with a single cry.  You bold men around me! You venturers, adventurers, and those of you who have embarked with cunning sails upon undiscovered seas! You who take pleasure in riddles! Solve for me the riddle that I saw, interpret to me the vision of the most solitary man! For it was a vision and a premonition: what did I see in allegory? And who is it that must come one day? Who is the shepherd into whose mouth the snake thus crawled? Who is the man into whose throat all that is heaviest, blackest will thus crawl? The shepherd, however, bit as my cry had advised him; he bit with a good bite! He spat far away the snake’s head – and sprang up.  No longer a shepherd, no longer a man – a transformed being, surrounded with light, laughing ! Never yet on earth had any man laughed as he laughed! O my brothers, I heard a laughter that was no human laughter – and now a thirst consumes me, a longing that is never stilled.  My longing for this laughter consumes me: oh how do I endure still to live! And how could I endure to die now! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Thousand and One Goals Z ARATHUSTRA has seen many lands and many peoples: thus he has discovered the good and evil of many peoples.  Zarathustra has found no greater power on earth than good and evil.  No people could live without evaluating; but if it wishes to maintain itself it must not evaluate as its neighbour evaluates.  Much that seemed good to one people seemed shame and disgrace to another: thus I found.  I found much that was called evil in one place was in another decked with purple honours.  One neighbour never understood another: his soul was always amazed at his neighbour’s madness and wickedness.  A table of values hangs over every people.  Behold, it is the table of its overcomings; behold, it is the voice of its will to power.  What it accounts hard it calls praiseworthy; what it accounts indispensable and hard it calls good; and that which relieves the greatest need, the rare, the hardest of all – it glorifies as holy.  Whatever causes it to rule and conquer and glitter, to the dread and envy of its neighbour, that it accounts the sublimest, the paramount, the evaluation and the meaning of all things.  Truly, my brother, if you only knew a people’s need and land and sky and neighbour, you could surely divine the law of its overcomings, and why it is upon this ladder that it mounts towards its hope.  ‘You should always be the first and outrival all others: your jealous soul should love no one, except your friend’ -this precept made the soul of a Greek tremble: in following it he followed his path to greatness.  ‘To speak the truth and to know well how to handle bow and arrow’ – this seemed both estimable and hard to that people from whom! got my name – a name which is both estimable and hard to me.  10 ‘To honour father and mother and to do their will even from the roots of the soul’: another people hung this table of overcoming over itself and became mighty and eternal with it.  ‘To practise loyalty and for the sake of loyalty to risk honour and blood even in evil and dangerous causes’: another people mastered itself with such teaching, and thus mastering itself it became pregnant and heavy with great hopes.  Truly, men have given themselves all their good and evil.  Truly, they did not take it, they did not find it, it did not descend to them as a voice from heaven.  Man first implanted values into things to maintain himself – he created the meaning of things, a human meaning! Therefore he calls himself: ‘Man’, that is: the evaluator.  Evaluation is creation: hear it, you creative men! Valuating is itself the value and jewel of all valued things.  Only through evaluation is there value: and without evaluation the nut of existence would be hollow.  Hear it, you creative men! A change in values – that means a change in the creators of values.  He who has to be a creator always has to destroy.  Peoples were the creators at first; only later were individuals creators.  Indeed, the individual himself is still the latest creation.  Once the peoples hung a table of values over themselves.  The love that wants to rule and the love that wants to obey created together such tables as these.  Joy in the herd is older than joy in the Ego: and as long as the good conscience is called herd, only the bad conscience says: I.  Truly, the cunning, loveless Ego, that seeks its advantage in the advantage of many – that is not the origin of the herd, but the herd’s destruction.  It has always been creators and loving men who created good and evil.  Fire of love and fire of anger glow in the names of all virtues.  Zarathustra has seen many lands and many peoples: Zarathustra has found no greater power on earth than the works of these loving men: these works are named ‘good’ and’ evil’.  Truly, the power of this praising and blaming is a monster.  Tell me, who will subdue it for me, brothers? Tell me, who will fasten fetters upon the thousand necks of this beast? Hitherto there have been a thousand goals, for there have been a thousand peoples.  Only fetters are still lacking for these thousand necks, the one goal is still lacking.  Yet tell me, my brothers: if a goal for humanity is still lacking, is there not still lacking – humanity itself? Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Retired from Service N OT long after Zarathustra had freed himself from the sorcerer, however, he again saw someone sitting beside the path he was going: a tall, dark man with a pale, haggard face; this man greatly vexed him.  ‘Alas,’ he said to his heart,’ there sits disguised affliction, he seems to be of the priestly sort: what do they want in my kingdom? ‘What! I have hardly escaped from that sorcerer: must another magician cross my path, ‘some wizard who operates by laying on hands, some gloomy miracle-worker by the grace of God, some anointed world-slanderer: may the Devil take him! ‘But the Devil is never in his proper place: he always comes too late, that confounded dwarf and club-foot!’ Thus cursed Zarathustra impatiently in his heart and considered how, with averted gaze, he might slip past the dark man: but behold, it turned out differently.  For at the same moment the sitting man had already seen him; and not unlike someone whom an unexpected happiness has befallen, he jumped up and went towards Zarathustra.  ‘Whoever you may be, traveller,’ he said, ‘help one who has gone astray, a seeker, an old man who may easily come to harm here! ‘The world here is strange and remote to me, and I hear the howling of wild animals; and he who could have afforded me protection is himself no more.  ‘I was seeking the last pious man, a saint and hermit who, alone in his forest, had as yet heard nothing of what all the world knows today.’ ‘What does all the world know today?’ asked Zarathustra.  ‘This, perhaps: that the old God in whom all the world once believed no longer lives?’ ‘That is so,’ answered the old man sadly.  ‘And I served that old God until his last hour.  ‘Now, however, I am retired from service, without master, and yet I am not free, neither am I merry even for an hour, except in memories.  ‘That is why I climbed into these mountains, that I might at last celebrate a festival once more, as becomes an old pope and church-father: for know, I am the last pope! – a festival of pious memories and divine services.  ‘But now he himself is dead, the most pious of men, that saint in the forest who used continually to praise his God with singing and muttering.  ‘When I found his hut I no longer found him himself, but I did find two wolves in it, howling over his death – for all animals loved him.  Then I hurried away.  ‘Had I come into these forests and mountains in vain? Then my heart decided to seek another, the most pious of all those who do not believe in God – to seek Zarathustra!’ Thus spoke the old man and gazed with penetrating eyes at him who stood before him; Zarathustra, however, took the old pope’s hand and for a long time regarded it admiringly.  ‘Behold, venerable man.’ he said then, ‘what a long and beautiful hand! It is the hand of one who has always distributed blessings.  But now it holds fast him you seek, me, Zarathustra.  ‘It is I, the godless Zarathustra, the same who says: Who is more godless than I, that I may rejoice in his teaching?’ Thus spoke Zarathustra and pierced with his glance the thoughts and reservations of the old pope.  At last the latter began: ‘He who loved and possessed him most, he has now lost him the most also: ‘behold, am I myself not the more godless of us two now? But who could rejoice in that!’ ‘You served him to the last,’ asked Zarathustra thoughtfully, after a profound silence, ‘do you know how he died? Is it true what they say, that pity choked him, ‘that he saw how man hung on the Gross and could not endure it, that love for man became his Hell and at last his death?’ The old pope, however, did not answer, but looked away shyly and with a pained and gloomy expression.  ‘Let him go,’ said Zarathustra after prolonged reflection, during which he continued to gaze straight in the old man’s eye.  ‘Let him go, he is finished.  And although it honours you that you speak only good of this dead god, yet you know as well as I who he was; and that he followed strange paths.’ ‘Between ourselves,’ said the old pope, becoming cheerful, ‘or, as I may say, spoken beneath three eyes’ 44 (for he was blind in one eye) ‘in divine matters I am more enlightened than Zarathustra himself – and may well be so.  ‘My love served him long years, my will obeyed all his will.  A good servant, however, knows everything, and many things, too, that his master hides from himself.  ‘He was a hidden god, full of secrecy.  Truly, he even came by a son through no other than secret and indirect means.  At the door of faith in him stands adultery.  ‘Whoever honours him as a god of love does not think highly enough of love itself.  Did this god not also want to be judge? But the lover loves beyond reward and punishment.  ‘When he was young, this god from the orient, he was hard and revengeful and built himself a Hell for the delight of his favourites.  ‘But at length he grew old and soft and mellow and compassionate, more like a grandfather than a father, most like a tottery old grandmother.  ‘Then he sat, shrivelled, in his chimney corner, fretting over his weak legs, world-weary, weary of willing, and one day suffocated through his excessive pity.’ ‘Old pope,’ Zarathustra interposed at this point, ‘did you see that with your own eyes? It certainly could have happened like that: like that, and also otherwise.  When gods die, they always die many kinds of death.  ‘But very well! One way or the other, one way and the other – he is gone! He offended the taste of my ears and eyes, I will say no worse of him.  ‘I love everything that is clear-eyed and honest of speech.  But he – you must know it, old priest, there was something of your nature about him, something of the priestly nature – he was ambiguous.  ‘He was also indistinct.  How angry he was with us, this shorter of wrath, because we mistook his meaning! But why did he not speak more clearly? ‘And if our ears were to blame, why did he give us ears that were unable to hear him properly? If there was dirt in our ears, very well! who put it there? ‘He had too many failures, this potter who had not learned his craft I But that he took vengeance on his pots and creations because they had turned out badly – that was a sin against good taste .  ‘There is also good taste in piety: that said at last: Away with such a god! Better no god, better to produce destiny on one’s own account, better to be a fool, better to be God oneself!’ ‘What do I hear!’ the old pope said at this point, pricking up his ears; ‘O Zarathustra, you are more pious than you believe, with such an unbelief! Some god in you has converted you to your godlessness.  ‘Is it not your piety itself that no longer allows you to believe in a god? And your exceeding honesty will yet carry you off beyond good and evil, too! ‘For behold, what has been reserved for you? You have eyes and hand and mouth destined for blessing from eternity.  One does not bless with the hand alone.  ‘In your neighbourhood, although you would be the most godless, I scent a stealthy odour of holiness and well-being that comes from long benedictions: it fills me with joy and sorrow.  ‘Let me be your guest, O Zarathustra, for a single night! Nowhere on earth shall I be happier now than with you!’ ‘Amen! So shall it be!’ said Zarathustra in great astonishment, ‘up yonder leads the way, there lies Zarathustra’s cave.  ‘Indeed, I would gladly lead you there myself, venerable man, for I love all pious men.  But now a cry of distress calls me hurriedly away from you.  ‘I will have no one come to harm in my domain; my cave is an excellent refuge.  And most of all I should like to set every sad and sorrowful person again on firm land and firm legs.  ‘Who, however, could lift your melancholy from your shoulders? I am too weak for that.  Truly, we should have to wait a long time before someone reawakened your god for you.  ‘For this old god no longer lives: he is quite dead.’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Three Evil Things 1 I N a dream, in my last morning dream, I stood today upon a headland – beyond the world, I held a pair of scales and weighed the world.  Oh, that the dawn came to me too soon! It glowed me into wakefulness, the jealous dawn! It is always jealous of the glow of my morning dreams.  Measurable to him who has time, weighable to a good weigher, accessible to strong pinions, divinable to divine nutcrackers: thus did my dream find the world.  My dream, a bold sailor, half ship half hurricane, silent as a butterfly, impatient as a falcon: how did it have time and patience today for weighing of worlds? Did my wisdom perhaps speak secretly to it, my laughing, wakeful day-wisdom that mocks all ‘infinite worlds’? For my wisdom says: ‘Where power is, there number becomes master: it has more power.’ How confidently did my dream gaze upon this finite world, eager neither for new things nor for old; neither in awe nor in supplication – as if a round apple presented itself to my hand, a ripe, golden apple with a soft, cool, velvety skin – thus the world presented itself to me – as if a tree nodded to me, a wide-branching, strong-willed tree, bent for reclining and as a footstool for the way-weary: thus the world stood upon my headland – as if tender hands brought me a casket – a casket open for the delight of modest, adoring eyes: thus the world presented himself before me today – not so enigmatic as to frighten away human love, not so explicit as to put to sleep human wisdom – a good, human thing was the world to me today, this world of which so many evil things are said! How grateful I am to my morning dream, that today in the early morning I thus weighed the world! It came to me as a good, human thing, this dream and comforter of the heart! And that I may do the same as it by day and learn and imitate its best aspects, I will now place the three most evil things upon the scales and weigh them well and humanly.  He who taught how to bless also taught how to curse: which are the three most-cursed things in the world? I will place these upon the scales.  Sensual pleasure, lust for power, selfishness : these three have hitherto been cursed the most and held in the worst and most unjust repute – these three will I weigh well and humanly.  Well then! Here is my headland and there is the sea: it rolls towards me, shaggy, fawning, the faithful old hundred-headed canine monster that I love.  Well then! Here I will hold the scales over the rolling sea: and I choose a witness, too, to look on – you, hermit tree, you heavy-odoured, broad-arched tree that I love! Upon what bridge does the present go over to the hereafter? What compulsion compels the high to bend to the low? And what bids even the highest – to grow higher still? Now the scales stand level and still: I have thrown in three weighty questions, the other scale bears three weighty answers.  2 Sensual pleasure: goad and stake to all hair-shirted despisers of the body and anathematized as ‘the world’ by all afterworldsmen: for it mocks and makes fools of all teachers of confusion and error.  Sensual pleasure: to the rabble the slow fire over which they are roasted; to all worm-eaten wood, to all stinking tatters, the ever-ready stewing-oven of lust.  Sensual pleasure: innocent and free to free hearts, the earth’s garden-joy, an overflowing of thanks to the present from all the future.  Sensual pleasure: a sweet poison only to the withered, but to the lion-willed the great restorative and reverently-preserved wine of wines.  Sensual pleasure: the great symbolic happiness of a higher happiness and highest hope.  For marriage is promised to many, and more than marriage – to many that are stranger to one another than man and woman: and who has fully conceived how strange man and woman are to one another! Sensual pleasure – but I will fence my thoughts round, and my words too: so that swine and hot fanatics shall not break into my garden! Lust for power: the scourge of fire of the hardest-hearted; the cruel torment reserved by the cruellest for himself; the dark flame of living bonfires.  Lust for power: the wicked fly seated upon the vainest peoples; the mocker of all uncertain virtue; which rides upon every horse and every pride.  Lust for power: the earthquake that breaks and bursts open all that is decayed and hollow; the rolling, growling, punitive destroyer of whitewashed sepulches; the flashing question-mark beside premature answers.  Lust for power: before its glance man crawls and bends and toils and becomes lower than the swine or the snake – until at last the cry of the great contempt bursts from him – Lust for power: the fearsome teacher of the great contempt, who preaches in the face of cities and empires ‘Away with you!’ – until at last they themselves cry out ‘Away with me !’ Lust for power: which, however, rises enticingly even to the pure and the solitary and up to self-sufficient heights, glowing like a love that paints purple delights enticingly on earthly heavens.  Lust for power: but who shall call it lust , when the height longs to stoop down after power I Truly, there is no sickness and lust in such a longing and descent! That the lonely height may not always be solitary and sufficient to itself; that the mountain may descend to the valley and the wind of the heights to the lowlands – Oh who shall find the rightful baptismal and virtuous name for such a longing! ‘Bestowing virtue’ – that is the name Zarathustra once gave the unnameable.  And then it also happened – and truly, it happened for the first time! – that his teaching glorified selfishness , the sound, healthy selfishness that issues from a mighty soul – from a mighty soul, to which pertains the exalted body, the beautiful, victorious, refreshing body, around which everything becomes a mirror; the supple, persuasive body, the dancer whose image and epitome is the self-rejoicing soul.  The self-rejoicing of such bodies and souls calls itself: ‘Virtue’.  Such self-rejoicing protects itself with its doctrines of good and bad as with sacred groves; with the names it gives its happiness it banishes from itself all that is contemptible.  It banishes from itself all that is cowardly; it says: Bad – that is to say, cowardly! He who is always worrying, sighing, complaining, and who gleans even the smallest advantage, seems contemptible to it.  It also despises all woeful wisdom: for truly, there is also a wisdom that blossoms in darkness, a night-shade wisdom, which is always sighing: ‘All is vain!’ Timid mistrustfulness seems base to it, as do all who desire oaths instead of looks and hands; and all-too-mistrustful wisdom, for such is the nature of cowardly souls.  It regards as baser yet him who is quick to please, who, dog-like, lies upon his back, the humble man; and there is also a wisdom that is humble and dog-like and pious and quick to please.  Entirely hateful and loathsome to it is he who will never defend himself, who swallows down poisonous spittle and evil looks, the too-patient man who puts up with everything, is content with everything: for that is the nature of slaves.  Whether one be servile before gods and divine kicks, or before men and the silly opinions of men: it spits at skyes of all kinds, this glorious selfishness! Bad: that is what it calls all that is broken-down and niggardly-servile, unclear, blinking eyes, oppressed hearts, and that false, yielding type of man who kisses with broad, cowardly lips.  And sham-wisdom: that is what it calls all wit that slaves and old men and weary men affect; and especially the whole bad, raving, over-clever priest-foolishness! And to ill-use selfishness – precisely that has been virtue and called virtue.  And ‘selfless’ – that is what, with good reason, all these world-weary cowards and Cross-spiders wished to be! But now the day, the transformation, the sword of judgement, the great noontide comes to them all: then many things shall be revealed! And he who declares the Ego healthy and holy and selfishness glorious – truly, he, a prophet, declares too what he knows: ‘Behold, it comes, it is near, the great noontide !’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Virtuous O NE has to speak with thunder and heavenly fireworks to feeble and dormant senses.  But the voice of beauty speaks softly: it steals into only the most awakened souls.  Gently my mirror trembled and laughed to me today; it was beauty’s holy laughter and trembling.  My beauty laughed at you, you virtuous, today.  And thus came its voice to me: ‘They want to be – paid as well!’ You want to be paid as well, you virtuous! Do you want reward for virtue and heaven for earth and eternity for your today? And are you now angry with me because I teach that there is no reward-giver nor paymaster? And truly, I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward.  Alas, this is my sorrow: reward and punishment have been lyingly introduced into the foundation of things – and now even into the foundation of your souls, you virtuous! But my words, like the snout of the boar, shall tear up the foundations of your souls; you shall call me a ploughshare.  All the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and when you lie, grubbed up and broken, in the sunlight, then your falsehood will be separated from your truth.  For this is your truth: You are too pure for the dirt of the words: revenge, punishment, reward, retribution.  You love your virtue as the mother her child; but when was it heard of a mother wanting to be paid for her love? Your virtue is your dearest self.  The ring’s desire is in you: to attain itself again – every ring struggles and turns itself to that end.  And every work of your virtue is like a star extinguished: its light is for ever travelling – and when will it cease from travelling? Thus the light of your virtue is still travelling even when its task is done.  Though it be forgotten and dead, its beam of light still lives and travels.  That your virtue is your Self and not something alien, a skin, a covering: that is the truth from the bottom of your souls, you virtuous! But there are indeed those to whom virtue is a writhing under the whip: and you have listened too much to their cries! And with others, their vices grow lazy and they call that virtue; and once their hatred and jealousy stretch themselves to rest, their ‘justice’ becomes lively and rubs its sleepy eyes.  And there are others who are drawn downward: their devils draw them.  But the more they sink, the more brightly shines their eye and the longing for their God.  Alas, their cry, too, has come to your ears, you virtuous: ‘What I am not , that, that to me is God and virtue!’ And there are others who go along, heavy and creaking, like carts carrying stones downhill: they speak much of dignity and virtue – their brake they call virtue! And there are others who are like household clocks wound up; they repeat their tick-tock and want people to call tick-tock – virtue.  Truly, I have fun with these: wherever I find such clocks I shall wind them up with my mockery; let them chime as well as tick! And others are proud of their handful of righteousness and for its sake commit wanton outrage upon all things: so that the world is drowned in their unrighteousness.  Alas, how ill the word ‘virtue’ sounds in their mouths! And when they say: ‘I am just,’ it always sounds like: ‘I am revenged!’ 15 They want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies with their virtue; and they raise themselves only in order to lower others.  And again, there are those who sit in their swamp and speak thus from the rushes: ‘Virtue – that means to sit quietly in the swamp.  ‘We bite nobody and avoid him who wants to bite: and in everything we hold the opinion that is given us.’ And again, there are those who like posing and think: Virtue is a sort of pose.  Their knees are always worshipping and their hands are glorifications of virtue, but their heart knows nothing of it.  And again, there are those who hold it a virtue to say: ‘Virtue is necessary’; but fundamentally they believe only that the police are necessary.  And many a one who cannot see the sublime in man calls it virtue that he can see his baseness all-too-closely: thus he calls his evil eye virtue.  And some want to be edified and raised up and call it virtue; and others want to be thrown down – and call it virtue too.  And in that way almost everyone firmly believes he is participating in virtue; and at least asserts he is an expert on ‘good’ and ‘evil’.  But Zarathustra has not come to say to all these liars and fools: ‘What do you know of virtue? What could you know of virtue?’ No, he has come that you, my friends, might grow weary of the old words you have learned from the fools and liars.  That you might grow weary of the words ‘reward’, ‘retribution’, ‘punishment’, ‘righteous revenge’.  That you might grow weary of saying: ‘An action is good when it is unselfish.’ Ah, my friends I That your Self be in the action, as the mother is in the child: let that be your maxim of virtue! Truly, I have taken a hundred maxims and your virtues’ dearest playthings away from you; and you scold me now, as children scold.  They were playing on the sea-shore – then came a wave and swept their playthings into the deep: now they cry.  But the same wave shall bring them new playthings and pour out new coloured sea-shells before them! Thus they will be consoled; and you too, my friends, shall, like them, have your consolations – and new coloured sea-shells! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the New Idol T HERE are still peoples and herds somewhere, but not with us, my brothers: here there are states.  The state? What is that? Well then! Now open your ears, for now I shall speak to you of the death of peoples.  The state is the coldest of all cold monsters.  Coldly it lies, too; and this lie creeps from its mouth: ‘I, the state, am the people.’ It is a lie! It was creators who created peoples and hung a faith and a love over them: thus they served life.  It is destroyers who set snares for many and call it the state: they hang a sword and a hundred desires over them.  Where a people still exists, there the people do not understand the state and hate it as the evil eye and sin against custom and law.  I offer you this sign: every people speaks its own language of good and evil: its neighbour does not understand this language.  It invented this language for itself in custom and law.  But the state lies in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it says, it lies – and whatever it has, it has stolen.  Everything about it is false; it bites with stolen teeth.  Even its belly is false.  Confusion of the language of good and evil; I offer you this sign as the sign of the state.  Truly, this sign indicates the will to death! Truly, it beckons to the preachers of death! Many too many are born: the state was invented for the superfluous! Just see how it lures them, the many-too-many! How it devours them, and chews them, and re-chews them! ‘There is nothing greater on earth than I, the regulating finger of God’ – thus the monster bellows.  And not only the long-eared and short-sighted sink to their knees! Ah, it whispers its dismal lies to you too, you great souls! Ah, it divines the abundant hearts that like to squander themselves! Yes, it divines you too, you conquerors of the old God! You grew weary in battle and now your weariness serves the new idol! It would like to range heroes and honourable men about it, this new idol! It likes to sun itself in the sunshine of good consciences – this cold monster! It will give you everything if you worship it, this new idol: thus it buys for itself the lustre of your virtues and the glance of your proud eyes.  It wants to use you to lure the many-too-many.  Yes, a cunning device of Hell has here been devised, a horse of death jingling with the trappings of divine honours! Yes, a death for many has here been devised that glorifies itself as life: truly, a heart-felt service to all preachers of death! I call it the state where everyone, good and bad, is a poison-drinker: the state where everyone, good and bad, loses himself: the state where universal slow suicide is called – life.  Just look at these superfluous people! They steal for themselves the works of inventors and the treasures of the wise: they call their theft culture – and they turn everything to sickness and calamity.  Just look at these superfluous people! They are always ill, they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper.  They devour one another and cannot even digest themselves.  Just look at these superfluous people! They acquire wealth and make themselves poorer with it.  They desire power and especially the lever of power, plenty of money – these impotent people! See them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one another and so scuffle into the mud and the abyss.  They all strive towards the throne: it is a madness they have – as if happiness sat upon the throne! Often filth sits upon the throne – and often the throne upon filth, too.  They all seem madmen to me and clambering apes and too vehement.  Their idol, that cold monster, smells unpleasant to me: all of them, all these idolaters, smell unpleasant to me.  My brothers, do you then want to suffocate in the fumes of their animal mouths and appetites? Better to break the window and leap into the open air.  Avoid this bad odour! Leave the idolatry of the superfluous! Avoid this bad odour! Leave the smoke of these human sacrifices! The earth still remains free for great souls.  Many places -the odour of tranquil seas blowing about them – are still empty for solitaries and solitary couples.  A free life still remains for great souls.  Truly, he who possesses little is so much the less possessed: praised be a moderate poverty! Only there, where the state ceases, does the man who is not superfluous begin: does the song of the necessary man, the unique and irreplaceable melody, begin.  There, where the state ceases – look there, my brothers.  Do you not see it: the rainbow and the bridges to the Superman? Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra On the Mount of Olives W INTER , an ill guest, sits in my house; my hands are blue from his friendly handshake.  I honour him, this ill guest, but I am glad to let him sit alone.  I gladly run away from him; and if you run well you can escape him! With warm feet and warm thoughts do I run yonder where the wind is still, to the sunny corner of my mount of olives.  There I laugh at my stern guest and am still fond of him, for he drives the flies away and silences many little noises for me at home.  For he will not permit even a gnat to buzz about, far less two gnats; and he makes the streets lonely, so that the moonlight is afraid there at night.  He is a hard guest, but I honour him, and do not pray to a fat-bellied fire-idol, as the weaklings do.  Rather a little chattering of teeth than idol-worship! – so my nature will have it.  And I especially detest all lustful, steaming, musty fire-idols.  Whom I love I love better in winter than in summer; I now mock my enemies better and more heartily, since winter sits in my home.  Heartily, in truth, even when I crawl into bed – even there my hidden happiness laughs and grows wanton; even my deceptive dream laughs.  I, a – crawler? Never in my life have I crawled before the powerful; and if I ever lied, I lied from love.  For that reason I am joyful even in my winter bed.  A meagre bed warms me more than an opulent one, for I am jealous of my poverty.  And it is most faithful to me in the winter.  I start each day with a wickedness, I mock winter with a cold bath: my stern house-companion grumbles at that.  I also like to tickle him with a wax candle: so that he may finally let the sky emerge from an ash-grey dawn.  For I am especially wicked in the morning: at the early hour when the bucket clatters at the well and horses neigh warmly in grey streets.  Then I wait impatiently, until the luminous sky at last dawns for me, the snowy-bearded winter sky, the white-haired, ancient sky – the silent, whiter sky, that often conceals even its sun! Did I learn long, luminous silence from it? Or did it learn it from me? Or did each of us devise it himself? The origin of all good things is thousand fold – all good, wanton things spring for joy into existence: how should they do that – once only? Long silence is also a good, wanton thing, and to gaze like the winter sky from a luminous, round-eyed countenance – like it, to conceal one’s sun and one’s inflexible sun-will: truly, I have learned well this art and this winter wantonness! It is my favourite wickedness and art, that my silence has learned not to betray itself by silence.  Rattling words and dice have I outwitted the solemn attendants: my will and purpose shall elude all the stern watchers.  So that no one might see down into my profundity and ultimate will – that is why I devised my long, luminous silence.  I have found so many shrewd men who veiled their faces and troubled their waters, so that no one might see through them and under them.  But the shrewder distrusters and nut-crackers came straight to them: straightway they fished out their best-hidden fish! But the clear, the honest, the transparent – they seem to me the shrewdest silent men: those whose profundity is so deep that even the clearest water does not – betray it.  You snowy-bearded winter sky, you round-eyed, white-haired sky above me! O you heavenly image of my soul and its wantonness! And do I not have to hide myself, like one who has swallowed gold, so that my soul shall not be slit open? Do I not have to wear stilts, so that they may not notice my long legs – all these envious and injurious people around me? These reeky, cosy, worn-out, mouldy, woebegone souls – how could their envy endure my happiness? So I show them only ice and winter on my peaks – and not that my mountain also winds all the girdles of sunlight around it! They hear only the whistling of my winter storms: and not that I also fare over warm seas, like passionate, heavy, hot south winds.  They even pity my accidents and chances: but my doctrine is: ‘Let chance come to me: it is as innocent as a little child!’ How could they endure my happiness, if I did not put accidents and the miseries of winter and fur-hats and coverings of snow-clouds around my happiness! – if I did not myself pity their pity , the pity of these envious and injurious people! – if I myself did not sigh and let my teeth chatter in their presence, and patiently let myself be wrapped up in their pity! This is the wise wantonness and benevolence of my soul: it does not bide its winter and frosty storms; neither does it hide its chilblains.  For one person, solitude is the escape of an invalid; for another, solitude is escape from the invalids.  Let them bear me chattering and sighing with winter cold, all these poor, squint-eyed knaves around me! With such sighing and chattering have I escaped their heated rooms.  Let them pity me and sigh with me over my chilblains: ‘He will yet freeze to death on the ice of knowledge!’ – so they wail.  In the meanwhile, I run with warm feet hither and thither upon my mount of olives: in the sunny corner of my mount of olives do I sing and mock all pity.  Thus sang Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra PART THREE ‘ You look up when you desire to be exalted.  And I look down, because I am exalted .  ‘ Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? ‘ He who climbs upon the highest mountains laughs at all tragedies, real or imaginary .  ’ ZARATHUSTRA: ‘ Of Reading and Writing ’ The Wanderer I T was midnight when Zarathustra made his way over the ridge of the island, so that he might arrive at the other shore with the early dawn: for there he meant to board ship.  For there was a good harbour at which foreign ships, too, liked to drop anchor: they took on board many who wanted to leave the Blissful Islands and cross the sea.  Now, as Zarathustra was climbing the mountain he recalled as he went the many lonely wanderings he had made from the time of his youth, and how many mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed.  I am a wanderer and a mountain-climber (he said to his heart), I do not like the plains and it seems I cannot sit still for long.  And whatever may yet come to me as fate and experience – a wandering and a mountain-climbing will be in it: in the final analysis one experiences only oneself.  The time has passed when accidents could befall me; and what could still come to me that was not already my own? It is returning, at last it is coming home to me – my own Self and those parts of it that have long been abroad and scattered among all things and accidents.  And I know one thing more: I stand now before my last summit and before the deed that has been deferred the longest.  Alas, I have to climb my most difficult path! Alas, I have started upon my loneliest wandering! But a man of my sort does not avoid such an hour: the hour that says to him: ‘Only now do you tread your path of greatness! Summit and abyss – they are now united in one! ‘You are treading your path of greatness: now what was formerly your ultimate danger has become your ultimate refuge! ‘You are treading your path of greatness: now it must call up all your courage that there is no longer a path behind you! ‘You are treading your path of greatness: no one shall steal after you here! Your foot itself has extinguished the path behind you, and above that path stands written: Impossibility.  ‘And when all footholds disappear, you must know how to climb upon your own head: how could you climb upward otherwise? ‘Upon your own head and beyond your own heart! Now the gentlest part of you must become the hardest.  ‘He who has always been very indulgent with himself sickens at last through his own indulgence.  All praise to what makes hard! I do not praise the land where butter and honey – flow! ‘In order to see much one must learn to look away from oneself – every mountain-climber needs this hardness.  ‘But he who, seeking enlightenment, is over-eager with his eyes, how could he see more of a thing than its foreground! ‘You, however, O Zarathustra, have wanted to behold the ground of things and their background: 24 so you must climb above yourself – up and beyond, until you have even your stars under you!’ Yes! To look down upon myself and even upon my stars: that alone would I call my summit , that has remained for me as my ultimate summit! Thus spoke Zarathustra to himself as he climbed, consoling his heart with hard sayings: for his heart was wounded as never before.  And when he arrived at the top of the mountain ridge, behold, there lay the other sea spread out before him: and he stood and was long silent.  But the night at this height was cold and dear and bright with stars.  I know my fate (he said at last with sadness).  Well then! I am ready.  My last solitude has just begun.  Ah, this sorrowful, black sea beneath me! Ah, this brooding reluctance! Ah, destiny and sea! Now I have to go down to you! I stand before my highest mountain and my longest wandering: therefore I must first descend deeper than I have ever descended, – deeper into pain than I have ever descended, down to its blackest stream! So my destiny will have it.  Well then! I am ready.  Whence arise the highest mountains? I once asked.  Then I learned that they arise from the sea.  This testimony is written into their stones and into the sides of their summits.  The highest must arise to its height from the deepest.  Thus spoke Zarathustra on the mountain summit, where it was cold; when he drew near to the sea, however, and at length stood alone beneath the cliffs, he had grown weary on the way and more yearning than he was before.  Everything is still asleep (he said); even the sea is asleep.  Its eye looks at me drowsily and strangely.  But it breathes warmly; I feel it.  And I feel, too, that it is dreaming.  Dreaming, it writhes upon a hard pillow.  Listen! Listen! How it groans with wicked memories! Or with wicked expectations? Ah, I am sad with you, dark monster, and angry even with myself for your sake.  Alas, that my hand has insufficient strength! In truth, I should dearly like to release you from your bad dreams! And as Zarathustra thus spoke, he laughed at himself with melancholy and bitterness.  What, Zarathustra! he said, do you want to sing consolation even to the sea? Ah, you fond fool, Zarathustra, too eager to trust! But that is what you have always been: you have always approached trustfully all that is fearful.  You have always wanted to caress every monster.  A touch of warm breath, a little soft fur on its paw – and at once you have been ready to love and entice it.  Love is the danger for the most solitary man, love of any thing if only it is alive! Indeed, my foolishness and modesty in love is laughable! Thus spoke Zarathustra and laughed again: but then he thought of the friends he had left, and he was angry with himself because of his thoughts, as if he had injured his friends with them.  And forthwith the laughing man wept – for anger and longing did Zarathustra weep bitterly.

Let them not learn differently nor teach differently, but only bid farewell to their own bodies – and so become dumb.  ‘I am body and soul’ – so speaks the child.  And why should one not speak like children? But the awakened, the enlightened man says: I am body entirely, and nothing beside; and soul is only a word for something in the body.  The body is a great intelligence, a multiplicity with one sense, a war and a peace, a herd and a herdsman.  Your little intelligence, my brother, which you call ‘spirit’, is also an instrument of your body, a little instrument and toy of your great intelligence.  You say ‘I’ and you are proud of this word.  But greater than this – although you will not believe in it – is your body and its great intelligence, which does not say ‘I’ but performs ‘I’.  What the sense feels, what the spirit perceives, is never an end in itself.  But sense and spirit would like to persuade you that they are the end of all things: they are as vain as that.  Sense and spirit are instruments and toys: behind them still lies the Self.  The Self seeks with the eyes of the sense, it listens too with the ears of the spirit.  The Self is always listening and seeking: it compares, subdues, conquers, destroys.  It rules and is also the Ego’s ruler.  Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, stands a mighty commander, an unknown sage – he is called Self.  He lives in your body, he is your body.  There is more reason in your body than in your best wisdom.  And who knows for what purpose your body requires precisely your best wisdom? Your Self laughs at your Ego and its proud leapings.  ‘What are these leapings and flights of thought to me?’ it says to itself.  ‘A by-way to my goal.  I am the Ego’s leading-string and I prompt its conceptions.’ The Self says to the Ego: ‘Feel pain!’ Thereupon it suffers and gives thought how to end its suffering – and it is meant to think for just that purpose.  The Self says to the Ego: ‘Feel joy!’ Thereupon it rejoices and gives thought how it may often rejoice – and it is meant to think for just that purpose.  I want to say a word to the despisers of the body.  It is their esteem that produces this disesteem.  What is it that created esteem and disesteem and value and will? The creative Self created for itself esteem and disesteem, it created for itself joy and sorrow.  The creative body created spirit for itself, as a hand of its will.  Even in your folly and contempt, you despisers of the body, you serve your Self.  I tell you: your Self itself wants to die and turn away from life.  Your Self can no longer perform that act which it most desires to perform: to create beyond itself.  That is what it most wishes to do, that is its whole ardour.  But now it has grown too late for that: so your Self wants to perish, you despisers of the body.  Your Self wants to perish, and that is why you have become despisers of the body! For no longer are you able to create beyond yourselves.  And therefore you are now angry with life and with the earth.  An unconscious envy lies in the sidelong glance of your contempt.  I do not go your way, you despisers of the body! You are not bridges to the Superman! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Immaculate Perception W HEN the moon rose yesterday I thought it was about to give birth to a sun, it lay on the horizon so broad and pregnant.  But it was a liar with its pregnancy; and I will sooner believe in the man in the moon than in the woman.  To be sure, he is not much of a man, either, this timid night-reveller.  Truly, he travels over the roofs with a bad conscience.  For he is lustful and jealous, the monk in the moon, lustful for the earth and for all the joys of lovers.  No, I do not like him, this tomcat on the roofs! All who slink around half-closed windows are repugnant to me! Piously and silently he walks along on star-carpets: but I do not like soft-stepping feet on which not even a spur jingles.  Every honest man’s step speaks out: but the cat steals along over the ground.  Behold, the moon comes along catlike and without honesty.  This parable I speak to you sentimental hypocrites, to you of ‘pure knowledge’! I call you – lustful! You too love the earth and the earthly: I have divined you well! – but shame and bad conscience is in your love – you are like the moon! Your spirit has been persuaded to contempt of the earthly, but your entrails have not: these, however, are the strongest part of you! And now your spirit is ashamed that it must do the will of your entrails and follows by-ways and lying-ways to avoid its own shame.  ‘For me, the highest thing would be to gaze at life without desire and not, as a dog does, with tongue hanging out’ – thus speaks your mendacious spirit to itself: ‘To be happy in gazing, with benumbed will, without the grasping and greed of egotism – cold and ashen in body but with intoxicated moon-eyes! ‘For me, the dearest thing would be to love the earth as the moon loves it, and to touch its beauty with the eyes alone’ -thus the seduced one seduces himself.  ‘And let this be called by me immaculate perception of all things: that I desire nothing of things, except that I may lie down before them like a mirror with a hundred eyes.’ Oh, you sentimental hypocrites, you lustful men! You lack innocence in desire: and therefore you now slander desiring! Truly, you do not love the earth as creators, begetters, men joyful at entering upon a new existence! Where is innocence? Where there is will to begetting.  And for me, he who wants to create beyond himself has the purest will.  Where is beauty? Where I have to will with all my will; where I want to love and perish, that an image may not remain merely an image.  Loving and perishing: these have gone together from eternity.  Will to love: that means to be willing to die, too.  Thus I speak to you cowards! But now your emasculated leering wants to be called ‘contemplation’! And that which lets cowardly eyes touch it shall be christened ‘beautiful’! Oh, you befoulers of noble names! But it shall be your curse, you immaculate men, you of pure knowledge, that you will never bring forth, even if you lie broad and pregnant on the horizon! Truly, you fill your mouths with noble words: and are we supposed to believe that your hearts are overflowing, you habitual liars? But my words are poor, despised, halting words: I am glad to take what falls from the table at your feast.  Yet with them I can still – tell the truth to hypocrites! Yes, my fish-bones, shells, and prickly leaves shall – tickle hypocrites’ noses! There is always bad air around you and around your feasts: for your lustful thoughts, your lies and secrets are in the air! Only dare to believe in yourselves – in yourselves and in your entrails! He who does not believe in himself always lies.  You have put on the mask of a god, you ‘pure’: your dreadful coiling snake has crawled into the mask of a god.  Truly, you are deceivers, you ‘contemplative’! Even Zarathustra was once the fool of your divine veneer; he did not guess at the serpent-coil with which it was filled.  Once I thought I saw a god’s soul at play in your play, you of pure knowledge! Once I thought there was no better art than your arts! Distance concealed from me the serpent-filth, and the evil odour, and that a lizard’s cunning was prowling lustfully around.  But I approached you: then day dawned for me – and now it dawns for you – the moon’s love affair had come to an end! Just look! There it stands, pale and detected – before the dawn! For already it is coming, the glowing sun – its love of the earth is coming! All sun-love is innocence and creative desire! Just look how it comes impatiently over the sea! Do you not feel the thirst and the hot breath of its love? It wants to suck at the sea and drink the sea’s depths up to its height: now the sea’s desire rises with a thousand breasts.  It wants to be kissed and sucked by the sun’s thirst; it wants to become air and height and light’s footpath and light itself! Truly, like the sun do I love life and all deep seas.  And this I call knowledge: all that is deep shall rise up – to my height! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Ass Festival 1 A T this point in the litany, however, Zarathustra could no longer master himself; he cried out ‘Ye-a’ louder even than the ass, and sprang into the midst of his guests gone mad.  ‘But what are you doing, my friends?’ he cried, pulling the worshippers up from the ground.  ‘Woe to you if anyone else but Zarathustra had seen you.  ‘Everyone would adjudge you, with your new faith, to be the worst blasphemers or the most foolish of old women! ‘And you, old pope, how can you reconcile yourself to worshipping an ass as God in this way?’ ‘O Zarathustra,’ answered the pope, ‘forgive me, but in divine matters I am even more enlightened than you.  That stands to reason.  ‘Better to worship God in this shape than in no shape at all! Consider this saying, my exalted friend: you will quickly see that there is wisdom in such a saying.  ‘He who said “God is a spirit” took the biggest step and leap towards unbelief yet taken on earth: such a saying is not easily corrected! ‘My old heart leaps and bounds to know that there is something left on earth to worship.  Forgive a pious old pope’s heart that, O Zarathustra!’ ‘And you,’ said Zarathustra to the wanderer and shadow, ‘you call and think yourself a free spirit? And do you carry on here such priestly idolatries? ‘Truly, you behave here even worse than you did with your wicken brown maidens, you evil new believer!’ ‘It is bad enough,’ answered the wanderer and shadow, ‘you are right: but what can I do! The old God lives again, O Zarathustra, you may say what you will.  ‘It is all the fault of the ugliest man: he has awakened him again.  And if he says that he once killed him: with gods, death is always only a prejudice.’ ‘And you,’ said Zarathustra, ‘you evil old sorcerer, what were you doing? Who in this free age shall believe in you henceforth, if you believe in such godly asininities? ‘What you did was a stupidity; how could you, prudent man, do anything so stupid!’ ‘O Zarathustra,’ answered the prudent sorcerer, ‘you are right, it was a stupidity, and it was hard enough to do it.’ ‘And even you,’ said Zarathustra to the conscientious man of the spirit, ‘just consider, and lay your finger on your nose! For is there nothing here against your conscience? Is your spirit not too pure for this praying and the exhalations of these devotees?’ ‘There is something in it,’ answered the conscientious man and laid his finger on his nose, ‘there is something in this spectacle which even does my conscience good.  ‘I may not believe in God, perhaps: but it is certain that God seems to me most worthy belief in this form.  ‘God is supposed to be eternal according to the testimony of the most pious: he who has so much time takes his time.  As slow and as stupid as possible: but such a one can in that way go very far, none the less.  ‘And he who has too much spirit might well become infatuated with stupidity and folly.  Consider yourself, O Zarathustra! ‘You yourself – truly I even you could become an ass through abundance and wisdom.  ‘Does a consummate philosopher not like to walk on the most crooked paths? Appearance teaches it, O Zarathustra – your appearance!’ ‘And you yourself, finally,’ said Zarathustra and turned towards the ugliest man, who was still lying on the ground raising his arm up to the ass (for he was giving it wine to drink).  ‘Speak, you unutterable creature, what have you been doing? ‘You seem changed, your eyes are glowing, the mantle of the sublime covers your ugliness: what did you do? ‘Is it true what they say, that you have awakened him again? And why? Was he not with reason killed and done away with? ‘You yourself seem awakened: what did you do? Why did you reform? Why were you converted? Speak, you unutterable creature!’ ‘O Zarathustra,’ answered the ugliest man, ‘you are a rogue.  ‘Whether he still lives or lives again or is truly dead, which of us two knows that best? I ask you.  ‘But one thing I know -1 once learned it from you yourself, O Zarathustra: He who wants to kill most thoroughly – laughs .  ‘“One kills, not by anger but by laughter” – that is what you once said.  O Zarathustra, you obscure man, you destroyer without anger, you dangerous saint, you are a rogue!’ 2 Then, however, Zarathustra, amazed at such purely roguish answers, leaped back to the door of his cave and, turning towards all his guests, cried in a loud voice: ‘O all you clowns, you buffoons! Why do you pretend and dissemble before me! ‘How the heart of each of you writhed with joy and mischievousness, because you had at last again become as little children, that is, pious, ‘because you at last again behaved as children do, that is, prayed, clasped your hands and said “Dear God”! ‘But now leave this nursery, my own cave, where today every kind of childishness is at home.  Come out here and cool your hot childish wantonness and the clamour of your hearts! ‘To be sure: except you become as little children you shall not enter into this kingdom of heaven.’ (And Zarathustra pointed upwards with his hands.) ‘But we certainly do not want to enter into the kingdom of heaven: we have become men, so we want the kingdom of earth ’ 3 And Zarathustra began to speak once more.  ‘O my new friends,’ he said, ‘you strange men, you Higher Men, how well you please me now, ‘since you have become joyful again I Truly, you have all blossomed forth: for such flowers as you, I think, new festivals are needed.  ‘a little brave nonsense, some divine service and ass festival, some joyful old Zarathustra-fool, a blustering wind to blow your souls bright.  ‘Do not forget this night and this ass festival, you Higher Men! You devised that at my home, I take that as a good omen – only convalescents devise such things! ‘And if you celebrate it again, this ass festival, do it for love of yourselves, do it also for love of me! And in remembrance of me !’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra PART FOUR Alas, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the compassionate? And what in the world has caused more suffering than the follies of the compassionate? Woe to all lovers who cannot surmount pity ! Thus spoke the Devil to me once: Even God has bis Hell: it is bis love for man .  And I lately beard him say these words: God is dead; God has died of bit pity for man .  ZARATHUSTRA: ‘ Of the Compassionate ’ The Honey Offering A ND again months and years passed over Zarathustra’s soul, and he did not heed it; his hair, however, grew white.  One day, as he was sitting upon a stone before his cave and gazing silently out – but the outlook there is of the sea and tortuous abysses – his animals went thoughtfully around him and at last placed themselves in front of him.  ‘O Zarathustra,’ they said, ‘are you perhaps looking out for your happiness?’ – ‘Of what account is happiness?’ he answered.  ‘For long I have not aspired after happiness, I aspire after my work.’ ‘O Zarathustra,’ said the animals then, ‘you say that as one who has too many good things.  Do you not lie in a sky-blue lake of happiness?’ ‘You buffoons,’ answered Zarathustra and smiled, ‘how well you chose that image! But you know too that my happiness is heavy and not like a liquid wave: it oppresses me and will not leave me, and behaves like molten pitch.’ Then his animals again went thoughtfully around him and placed themselves once more in front of him.  ‘O Zarathustra,’ they said, ‘is that why you yourself are growing ever darker and more sallow, although your hair looks white and flaxen? Behold, you are sitting in your pitch!’ ‘What are you saying, my animals?’ said Zarathustra laughing.  ‘Truly, I spoke slander when I spoke of pitch.  What is happening to me happens to all fruits that grow ripe.  It is the honey in my veins that makes my blood thicker, and my soul quieter.’ ‘It will be so, O Zarathustra,’ answered the animals and pressed towards him; ‘but would you not like to climb a high mountain today? The air is clear, and today one can see more of the world than ever.’ ‘Yes, my animals,’ he answered, ‘your advice is admirable and after my own inclination: today I will climb a high mountain! But take care that I have honey ready to hand there, yellow, white, fine, ice-cool golden honey in the comb.  For I intend to offer the honey offering.’ But when Zarathustra had reached the summit he sent home the animals which had accompanied him, and found that he was now alone: then he laughed with his whole heart, looked around him and spoke thus: That I spoke of offerings and honey offerings was merely a ruse and, truly, a useful piece of folly! Up here I can speak more freely than before hermits’ caves and hermits’ pets.  Offer – what? I squander what is given me, I, a squanderer with a thousand hands: how could I call that – an offering! And when I desired honey, I desired only bait and sweet syrup and gum, which even grumbling bears and strange, sullen, wicked birds are greedy for: the finest bait, such as huntsmen and fishermen need.  For although the world is like a dark animal-jungle and a pleasure-ground for all wild huntsmen, it seems to me to be rather and preferably an unfathomable, rich sea, a sea full of many-coloured fishes and crabs for which even the gods might long and become fishers and casters of nets: so rich is the world in strange things, great and small! Especially the human world, the human sea: now I cast my golden fishing-rod into it and say: Open up, human abyss! Open up and throw me your fishes and glistening crabs! With my finest bait shall I bait today the strangest human fish! My happiness itself shall I cast far and wide, between sunrise, noontide, and sunset, to see if many human fishes will not learn to kick and tug at my happiness, until they, biting on my sharp, hidden hooks, have to come up to my height, the most multicoloured groundlings of the abyss to the most wicked of all fishers of men.  For I am he , from the heart and from the beginning, drawing, drawing towards me, drawing up to me, raising up, a drawer, trainer, and taskmaker who once bade himself, and not in vain: ‘Become what you are!’ Thus men may now come up to me: for I am still waiting for the signs that it is time for my descent; as yet I do not myself go down, as I must, among men.  Therefore I wait here, cunning and scornful upon high mountains, not impatient, not patient, on the contrary one who has unlearned even patience, because he no longer ‘suffers in patience’.  41 For my destiny is allowing me time: has it forgotten me? Or is it sitting in the shadows behind a great stone catching flies? And truly, I am grateful to my eternal destiny for not hunting and harrying me and for allowing me time for buffooneries and mischief: so that today I have climbed this high mountain to catch fish.  Has a man ever caught fish on a high mountain? And if what I want and do up here is a stupidity, better to do it than to become solemn and green and sallow by waiting down there, to become by waiting a pompous shorter of wrath, a holy howling storm from the mountains, an impatient man crying down into the valleys: ‘Listen, or I shall lash you with the scourge of God!’ Not that I should be angry with such wrathful men on that account! They are good enough for a laugh! How impatient they must be, these great alarm-drums that must find a voice today or never! But I and my destiny – we do not speak to Today, neither do we speak to the Never: we have patience and time and more than time.  For it must come one day and may not pass by.  What must come one day and may not pass by? Our great Hazar, our great, far-off empire of man, the thousand-year empire of Zarathustra.  How far off may that ‘far off’ be? What do I care! But I am not less certain of it on that account – I stand securely with both feet upon this foundation, upon this eternal foundation, upon hard, primordial rock, upon this highest, hardest primordial hill to which all the winds come as to the dividing-place of storms, asking Where? and Whence? and Whither? Here laugh, laugh my bright and wholesome wickedness! Down from high mountains cast your glistening, mocking laughter.  With your glistening bait for me the fairest human fish! And what belongs to me in all seas, my in-and-for-me in all things – fish it out for me, bring it here to me: I wait for it, I the wickedest of all fishermen.  Away, away my hook! In, down, bait for my happiness! Drop down your sweetest dew, honey of my heart! Bite, my hook, into the belly of all black affliction! Gaze out, gaze out, my eye! Oh how many seas round about me, what dawning human futures! And above me – what rosy stillness! What cloudless silence! Thus Spoke Zarathustra * I owe this insight to Mr Marvin Rintala, who in his review of my biography of Nietzsche in The Review of Polities , January 1969, said I had failed to understand in what the essence of Lutheran Pietism consisted, which was true, and then went on to expound it.  ‘The great petition of the Lord’s Prayer,’ says Mr Rintala, ‘is for Pietists: “Thy will be done”’.  This is so much in line with the Christian origin of the conceptions of Zarathustra that I ought to have guessed it even if I did not know it.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Marriage and Children I HAVE a question for you alone, my brother: I throw this question like a plummet into your soul, to discover how deep it is.  You are young and desire marriage and children.  But I ask you: are you a man who ought to desire a child? Are you the victor, the self-conqueror, the ruler of your senses, the lord of your virtues? Thus I ask you.  Or do the animal and necessity speak from your desire? Or isolation? Or disharmony with yourself? I would have your victory and your freedom long for a child.  You should build living memorials to your victory and your liberation.  You should build beyond yourself.  But first you must be built yourself, square-built in body and soul.  You should propagate yourself not only forward, but upward! 13 May the garden of marriage help you to do it! You should create a higher body, a first motion, a self-propelling wheel – you should create a creator.  Marriage: that I call the will of two to create the one who is more than those who created it.  Reverence before one another, as before the willers of such a will – that I call marriage.  Let this be the meaning and the truth of your marriage.  But that which the many-too-many, the superfluous, call marriage – ah, what shall I call it? Ah, this poverty of soul in partnership! Ah, this filth of soul in partnership! Ah, this miserable ease in partnership! All this they call marriage; and they say their marriages are made in Heaven.  Well, I do not like it, this Heaven of the superfluous! No, I do not like them, these animals caught in the heavenly net! And let the God who limps hither to bless what he has not joined stay far from me! Do not laugh at such marriages! What child has not had reason to weep over its parents? This man seemed to me worthy and ripe for the meaning of the earth: but when I saw his wife the earth seemed to me a house for the nonsensical.  Yes, I wish that the earth shook with convulsions when a saint and a goose mate together.  This man set forth like a hero in quest of truth and at last he captured a little dressed-up lie.  He calls it his marriage.  That man used to be reserved in his dealings and fastidious in his choice.  But all at once he spoilt his company once and for all: he calls it his marriage.  That man sought a handmaiden with the virtues of an angel.  But all at once he became the handmaiden of a woman, and now he needs to become an angel too.  I have found all buyers cautious, and all of them have astute eyes.  But even the most astute man buys his wife while she is still wrapped.  Many brief follies – that is called love with you.  And your marriage makes an end of many brief follies with one long stupidity.  Your love for woman and woman’s love for man: ah, if only it were pity for suffering and veiled gods! But generally two animals sense one another.  But even your best love too is only a passionate impersonation and a painful ardour.  It is a torch which should light your way to higher paths.  One day you shall love beyond yourselves! So first learn to love! For that you have had to drink the bitter cup of your love.  There is bitterness in the cup of even the best love: thus it arouses longing for the Superman, thus it arouses thirst in you, the creator! A creator’s thirst, arrow, and longing for the Superman: speak, my brother, is this your will to marriage? I call holy such a will and such a marriage.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra PART ONE ZARATHUSTRA’S PROLOGUE 1 W HEN Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home and went into the mountains.  Here he had the enjoyment of his spirit and his solitude and he did not weary of it for ten years.  But at last his heart turned – and one morning he rose with the dawn, stepped before the sun, and spoke to it thus: Great star! What would your happiness be, if you had not those for whom you shine! You have come up here to my cave for ten years: you would have grown weary of your light and of this journey, without me, my eagle and my serpent.  But we waited for you every morning, took from you your superfluity and blessed you for it.  Behold! I am weary of my wisdom, like a bee that has gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.  I should like to give it away and distribute it, until the wise among men have again become happy in their folly and the poor happy in their wealth.  To that end, I must descend into the depths: as you do at evening, when you go behind the sea and bring light to the underworld too, superabundant star! Like you, I must go down 1 – as men, to whom I want to descend, call it.  So bless me then, tranquil eye, that can behold without envy even an excessive happiness! Bless the cup that wants to overflow, that the waters may flow golden from him and bear the reflection of your joy over all the world! Behold! This cup wants to be empty again, and Zarathustra wants to be man again.  Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.  2 Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, and no one met him.  But when he entered the forest, an old man, who had left his holy hut to look for roots in the forest, suddenly stood before him.  And the old man spoke thus to Zarathustra: ‘This wanderer is no stranger to me: he passed by here many years ago.  He was called Zarathustra; but he has changed.  ‘Then you carried your ashes to the mountains: will you today carry your fire into the valleys? Do you not fear an incendiary’s punishment? ‘Yes, I recognize Zarathustra.  His eyes are clear, and no disgust lurks about his mouth.  Does he not go along like a dancer? ‘How changed Zarathustra is! Zarathustra has become – a child, an awakened-one: what do you want now with the sleepers? ‘You lived in solitude as in the sea, and the sea bore you.  Alas, do you want to go ashore? Alas, do you want again to drag your body yourself?’ Zarathustra answered: ‘I love mankind.’ ‘Why’, said the saint, ‘did I go into the forest and the desert? Was it not because I loved mankind all too much? ‘Now I love God: mankind I do not love.  Man is too imperfect a thing for me.  Love of mankind would destroy me.’ Zarathustra answered: ‘What did I say of love? I am bringing mankind a gift.’ ‘Give them nothing,’ said the saint.  ‘Rather take something off them and bear it with them – that will please them best; if only it be pleasing to you! ‘And if you want to give to them, give no more than an alms, and let them beg for that!’ ‘No,’ answered Zarathustra, ‘I give no alms.  I am not poor enough for that.’ The saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spoke thus:’ See to it that they accept your treasures! They are mistrustful of hermits, and do not believe that we come to give.  ‘Our steps ring too lonely through their streets.  And when at night they hear in their beds a man going by long before the sun has risen, they probably ask themselves: Where is that thief going? ‘Do not go to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the animals! Why will you not be as I am – a bear among bears, a bird among birds?’ ‘And what does the saint do in the forest?’ asked Zarathustra.  The saint answered: ‘I make songs and sing them, and when I make songs, I laugh, weep, and mutter: thus I praise God.  ‘With singing, weeping, laughing, and muttering I praise the God who is my God.  But what do you bring us as a gift?’ When Zarathustra heard these words, he saluted the saint and said: ‘What should I have to give you! But let me go quickly, that I may take nothing from you!’ And thus they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, laughing as two boys laugh.  But when Zarathustra was alone, he spoke thus to his heart: ‘Could it be possible! This old saint has not yet heard in his forest that God is dead !’ 3 When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest of the towns lying against the forest, he found in that very place many people assembled in the market square: for it had been announced that a tight-rope walker would be appearing.  And Zarathustra spoke thus to the people: I teach you the Superman .  Man is something that should be overcome.  What have you done to overcome him? All creatures hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and do you want to be the ebb of this great tide, and return to the animals rather than overcome man? What is the ape to men? A laughing-stock or a painful embarrassment.  And just so shall man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock or a painful embarrassment.  You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.  Once you were apes, and even now man is more of an ape than any ape.  But he who is the wisest among you, he also is only a discord and hybrid of plant and of ghost.  But do I bid you become ghosts or plants? Behold, I teach you the Superman.  The Superman is the meaning of the earth.  Let your will say: The Superman shall be the meaning of the earth! I entreat you, my brothers, remain true to the earth , and do not believe those who speak to you of superterrestrial hopes! They are poisoners, whether they know it or not.  They are despisers of life, atrophying and self-poisoned men, of whom the earth is weary: so let them be gone! Once blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy, but God died, and thereupon these blasphemers died too.  To blaspheme the earth is now the most dreadful offence, and to esteem the bowels of the Inscrutable more highly than the meaning of the earth.  Once the soul looked contemptuously upon the body: and then this contempt was the supreme good – the soul wanted the body lean, monstrous, famished.  So the soul thought to escape from the body and from the earth.  Oh, this soul was itself lean, monstrous, and famished: and cruelty was the delight of this soul! But tell me, my brothers: What does your body say about your soul? Is your soul not poverty and dirt and a miserable ease? In truth, man is a polluted river.  One must be a sea, to receive a polluted river and not be defiled.  Behold, I teach you the Superman: he is this sea, in him your great contempt can go under.  What is the greatest thing you can experience? It is the hour of the great contempt.  The hour in which even your happiness grows loathsome to you, and your reason and your virtue also.  The hour when you say: ‘What good is my happiness? It is poverty and dirt and a miserable ease.  But my happiness should justify existence itself!’ The hour when you say: ‘What good is my reason? Does it long for knowledge as the lion for its food? It is poverty and dirt and a miserable ease!’ The hour when you say: ‘What good is my virtue? It has not yet driven me mad! How tired I am of my good and my evil! It is all poverty and dirt and a miserable ease!’ The hour when you say: ‘What good is my justice? I do not see that I am fire and hot coals.  But the just man is fire and hot coals!’ The hour when you say: ‘What good is my pity? Is not pity the cross upon which he who loves man is nailed? But my pity is no crucifixion!’ Have you ever spoken thus? Have you ever cried thus? Ah, that I had heard you crying thus! It is not your sin, but your moderation that cries to heaven, your very meanness in sinning cries to heaven! Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the madness, with which you should be cleansed? Behold, I teach you the Superman: he is this lightning, he is this madness! When Zarathustra had spoken thus, one of the people cried: ‘Now we have heard enough of the tight-rope walker; let us see him, too!’ And all the people laughed at Zarathustra.  But the tight-rope walker, who thought that the words applied to him, set to work.  4 But Zarathustra looked at the people and marvelled.  Then he spoke thus: Man is a rope, fastened between animal and Superman – a rope over an abyss.  A dangerous going-across, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous shuddering and staying-still.  What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal; what can be loved in man is that he is a going-across and a down-going .  2 I love those who do not know how to live except their lives be a down-going, for they are those who are going across.  I love the great despisers, for they are the great venerators and arrows of longing for the other bank.  I love those who do not first seek beyond the stars for reasons to go down and to be sacrifices: but who sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth may one day belong to the Superman.  I love him who lives for knowledge and who wants knowledge that one day the Superman may live.  And thus he wills his own downfall.  I love him who works and invents that he may build a house for the Superman and prepare earth, animals, and plants for him: for thus he wills his own downfall.  I love him who loves his virtue: for virtue is will to downfall and an arrow of longing.  I love him who keeps back no drop of spirit for himself, but wants to be the spirit of his virtue entirely: thus he steps as spirit over the bridge.  I love him who makes a predilection and a fate of his virtue: thus for his virtue’s sake he will live or not live.  I love him who does not want too many virtues.  One virtue is more virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for fate to cling to.  I love him whose soul is lavish, who neither wants nor returns thanks: for he always gives and will not preserve himself.  I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour and who then asks: Am I then a cheat? – for he wants to perish.  I love him who throws golden words in advance of his deeds and always performs more than he promised: for he wills his own downfall.  I love him who justifies the men of the future and redeems the men of the past: for he wants to perish by the men of the present.  I love him who chastises his God because he loves his God: for he must perish by the anger of his God.  I love him whose soul is deep even in its ability to be wounded, and whom even a little thing can destroy: thus he is glad to go over the bridge.  I love him whose soul is overfull, so that he forgets himself and all things are in him: thus all things become his downfall.  I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus his head is only the bowels of his heart, but his heart drives him to his downfall.  I love all those who are like heavy drops falling singly from the dark cloud that hangs over mankind: they prophesy the coming of the lightning and as prophets they perish.  Behold, I am a prophet of the lightning and a heavy drop from the cloud: but this lightning is called Superman .  5 When Zarathustra had spoken these words he looked again at the people and fell silent.  There they stand (he said to his heart), there they laugh: they do not understand me, I am not the mouth for these ears.  Must one first shatter their ears to teach them to hear with their eyes? Must one rumble like drums and Lenten preachers? Or do they believe only those who stammer? They have something of which they are proud.  What is it called that makes them proud? They call it culture, it distinguishes them from the goatherds.  Therefore they dislike hearing the word ‘contempt’ spoken of them.  So I shall speak to their pride.  So I shall speak to them of the most contemptible man: and that is the Ultimate man .  And thus spoke Zarathustra to the people: It is time for man to fix his goal.  It is time for man to plant the seed of his highest hope.  His soil is still rich enough for it.  But this soil will one day be poor and weak; no longer will a high tree be able to grow from it.  Alas! The time is coming when man will no more shoot the arrow of his longing out over mankind, and the string of his bow will have forgotten how to twang! I tell you: one must have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star.  I tell you: you still have chaos in you.  Alas! The time is coming when man will give birth to no more stars.  Alas! The time of the most contemptible man is coming, the man who can no longer despise himself.  Behold! I shall show you the Ultimate Man , ‘What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?’ thus asks the Ultimate Man and blinks.  The earth has become small, and upon it hops the Ultimate Man, who makes everything small.  His race is as inextermin-able as the flea; the Ultimate Man lives longest.  ‘We have discovered happiness,’ say the Ultimate Men and blink.  They have left the places where living was hard: for one needs warmth.  One still loves one’s neighbour and rubs oneself against him: for one needs warmth.  Sickness and mistrust count as sins with them: one should go about warily.  He is a fool who still stumbles over stones or over men! A little poison now and then: that produces pleasant dreams.  And a lot of poison at last, for a pleasant death.  They still work, for work is entertainment.  But they take care the entertainment does not exhaust them.  Nobody grows rich or poor any more: both are too much of a burden.  Who still wants to rule? Who obey? Both are too much of a burden.  No herdsman and one herd.  Everyone wants the same thing, everyone is the same: whoever thinks otherwise goes voluntarily into the madhouse.  ‘Formerly all the world was mad,’ say the most acute of them and blink.  They are clever and know everything that has ever happened: so there is no end to their mockery.  They still quarrel, but they soon make up – otherwise indigestion would result.  They have their little pleasure for the day and their little pleasure for the night: but they respect health.  ‘We have discovered happiness,’ say the Ultimate Men and blink.  And here ended Zarathustra’s first discourse, which is also called ‘The Prologue’: 3 for at this point the shouting and mirth of the crowd interrupted him.  ‘Give us this Ultimate Man, O Zarathustra’ – so they cried – ‘make us into this Ultimate Man! You can have the Superman!’ And all the people laughed and shouted.  But Zarathustra grew sad and said to his heart: They do not understand me: I am not the mouth for these ears.  Perhaps I lived too long in the mountains, listened too much to the trees and the streams: now I speak to them as to goatherds.  Unmoved is my soul and bright as the mountains in the morning.  But they think me cold and a mocker with fearful jokes.  And now they look at me and laugh: and laughing, they still hate me.  There is ice in their laughter.  6 But then something happened that silenced every mouth and fixed every eye.  In the meantime, of course, the tight-rope walker had begun his work: he had emerged from a little door and was proceeding across the rope, which was stretched between two towers and thus hung over the people and the market square.  Just as he had reached the middle of his course the little door opened again and a brightly-dressed fellow like a buffoon sprang out and followed the former with rapid steps.  ‘Forward, lame-foot!’ cried his fearsome voice, ‘forward sluggard, intruder, pallid-face! Lest I tickle you with my heels! What are you doing here between towers? You belong in the tower, you should be locked up, you are blocking the way of a better man than you!’ And with each word he came nearer and nearer to him: but when he was only a single pace behind him, there occurred the dreadful thing that silenced every mouth and fixed every eye: he emitted a cry like a devil and sprang over the man standing in his path.  But the latter, when he saw his rival thus triumph, lost his head and the rope; he threw away his pole and fell, faster even than it, like a vortex of legs and arms.  The market square and the people were like a sea in a storm: they flew apart in disorder, especially where the body would come crashing down.  But Zarathustra remained still and the body fell quite close to him, badly injured and broken but not yet dead.  After a while, consciousness returned to the shattered man and he saw Zarathustra kneeling beside him.  ‘What are you doing?’ he asked at length.  ‘I’ve known for a long time that the Devil would trip me up.  Now he’s dragging me to Hell: are you trying to prevent him?’ ‘On my honour, friend,’ answered Zarathustra, ‘all you have spoken of does not exist: there is no Devil and no Hell.  Your soul will be dead even before your body: therefore fear nothing any more!’ The man looked up mistrustfully.  ‘If you are speaking the truth,’ he said then, ‘I leave nothing when I leave life.  I am not much more than an animal which has been taught to dance by blows and starvation.’ ‘Not so,’ said Zarathustra.  ‘You have made danger your calling, there is nothing in that to despise.  Now you perish through your calling: so I will bury you with my own hands.’ When Zarathustra had said this the dying man replied no more; but he motioned with his hand, as if he sought Zarathustra’s hand to thank him.  7 In the meanwhile, evening had come and the market square was hidden in darkness: then the people dispersed, for even curiosity and terror grow tired.  But Zarathustra sat on the ground beside the dead man and was sunk in thought: thus he forgot the time.  But at length it became night and a cold wind blew over the solitary figure.  Then Zarathustra arose and said to his heart: Truly, Zarathustra has had a handsome catch today! He caught no man, but he did catch a corpse.  Uncanny is human existence and still without meaning: a buffoon can be fatal to it.  I want to teach men the meaning of their existence: which is the Superman, the lightning from the dark cloud man.  But I am still distant from them, and my meaning does not speak to their minds.  To men, I am still a cross between a fool and a corpse.  Dark is the night, dark are Zarathustra’s ways.  Come, cold and stiff companion! I am going to carry you to the place where I shall bury you with my own hands.  8 When Zarathustra had said this to his heart he loaded the corpse on to his back and set forth.  He had not gone a hundred paces when a man crept up to him and whispered in his ear – and behold! it was the buffoon of the tower who spoke to him.  ‘Go away from this town, O Zarathustra,’ he said.  ‘Too many here hate you.  The good and the just hate you and call you their enemy and despiser; the faithful of the true faith hate you, and they call you a danger to the people.  It was lucky for you that they laughed at you: and truly you spoke like a buffoon.  It was lucky for you that you made company with the dead dog; by so abasing yourself you have saved yourself for today.  But leave this town – or tomorrow I shall jump over you, a living man over a dead one.’ And when he had said this, the man disappeared; Zarathustra, however, went on through the dark streets.  At the town gate the gravediggers accosted him: they shone their torch in his face, recognized Zarathustra and greatly derided him.  ‘Zarathustra is carrying the dead dog away: excellent that Zarathustra has become a gravedigger! For our hands are too clean for this roast.  Does Zarathustra want to rob the Devil of his morsel? Good luck then! A hearty appetite! But if the Devil is a better thief than Zarathustra! – he will steal them both, he will eat them both!’ And they laughed and put their heads together.  Zarathustra said nothing and went his way.  When he had walked for two hours past woods and swamps he had heard too much hungry howling of wolves and he grew hungry himself.  So he stopped at a lonely house in which a light was burning.  ‘Hunger has waylaid me’, said Zarathustra, ‘like a robber.  My hunger has waylaid me in woods and swamps, and in the depth of night.  ‘My hunger has astonishing moods.  Often it comes to me only after mealtimes, and today it did not come at all: where has it been?’ And with that, Zarathustra knocked on the door of the house.  An old man appeared; he carried a light and asked: ‘Who comes here to me and to my uneasy sleep?’ ‘A living man and a dead,’ said Zarathustra.’ Give me food and drink, I forgot about them during the day.  He who feeds the hungry refreshes his own soul: thus speaks wisdom.’ The old man went away, but returned at once and offered Zarathustra bread and wine.  ‘This is a bad country for hungry people,’ he said.  ‘That is why I live here.  Animals and men come here to me, the hermit.  But bid your companion eat and drink, he is wearier than you.’ Zarathustra answered: ‘My companion is dead, I shall hardly be able to persuade him.’ “That is nothing to do with me,’ said the old man morosely.  ‘Whoever knocks at my door must take what I offer him.  Eat, and fare you well!’ After that, Zarathustra walked two hours more and trusted to the road and to the light of the stars: for he was used to walking abroad at night and liked to look into the face of all that slept.  But when morning dawned, Zarathustra found himself in a thick forest and the road disappeared.  Then he laid the dead man in a hollow tree at his head – for he wanted to protect him from the wolves – and laid himself down on the mossy ground.  And straightway he fell asleep, weary in body but with a soul at rest.  9 Zarathustra slept long, and not only the dawn but the morning too passed over his head.  But at length he opened his eyes: in surprise Zarathustra gazed into the forest and the stillness, in surprise he gazed into himself.  Then he arose quickly, like a seafarer who suddenly sees land, and rejoiced: for he beheld a new truth.  And then he spoke to his heart thus: A light has dawned for me: I need companions, living ones, not dead companions and corpses which I carry with me wherever I wish.  But I need living companions who follow me because they want to follow themselves – and who want to go where I want to go.  A light has dawned for me: Zarathustra shall not speak to the people but to companions! Zarathustra shall not be herdsman and dog to the herd! To lure many away from the herd – that is why I have come.  The people and the herd shall be angry with me: the herdsmen shall call Zarathustra a robber.  I say herdsmen, but they call themselves the good and the just.  I say herdsmen: but they call themselves the faithful of the true faith.  Behold the good and the just! Whom do they hate most? Him who smashes their tables of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker 4 – but he is the creator.  Behold the faithful of all faiths! Whom do they hate the most? Him who smashes their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker – but he is the creator.  The creator seeks companions, not corpses or herds or believers.  The creator seeks fellow-creators, those who inscribe new values on new tables.  The creator seeks companions and fellow-harvesters: for with him everything is ripe for harvesting.  But he lacks his hundred sickles: so he tears off the ears of corn and is vexed.  The creator seeks companions and such as know how to whet their sickles.  They will be called destroyers and despisers of good and evil.  But they are harvesters and rejoicers.  Zarathustra seeks fellow-creators, fellow-harvesters, and fellow-rejoicers: what has he to do with herds and herdsmen and corpses! And you, my first companion, fare you well! I have buried you well in your hollow tree, I have hidden you well from the wolves.  But I am leaving you, the time has come.  Between dawn and dawn a new truth has come to me.  I will not be herdsman or gravedigger.  I will not speak again to the people: I have spoken to a dead man for the last time.  I will make company with creators, with harvesters, with rejoicers: I will show them the rainbow and the stairway to the Superman.  I shall sing my song to the lone hermit and to the hermits in pairs; and I will make the heart of him who still has ears for unheard-of things heavy with my happiness.  I make for my goal, I go my way; I shall leap over the hesitating and the indolent.  Thus may my going-forward be their going-down! 10 Zarathustra said this to his heart as the sun stood at noon: then he looked inquiringly into the sky – for he heard above him the sharp cry of a bird.  And behold! An eagle was sweeping through the air in wide circles, and from it was hanging a serpent, not like a prey but like a friend: for it was coiled around the eagle’s neck.  ‘It is my animals!’ said Zarathustra and rejoiced in his heart.  ‘The proudest animal under the sun and the wisest animal under the sun’ they have come scouting.  ‘They wanted to learn if Zarathustra was still alive.  Am I in fact alive? ‘I found it more dangerous among men than among animals; Zarathustra is following dangerous paths.  May my animals lead me!’ When Zarathustra had said this he recalled the words of the saint in the forest, sighed, and spoke thus to his heart: ‘I wish I were wise! I wish I were wise from the heart of me, like my serpent! ‘But I am asking the impossible: therefore I ask my pride always to go along with my wisdom! ‘And if one day my wisdom should desert me – ah, it loves to fly away! – then may my pride too fly with my folly!’ Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Prophet –AND I saw a great sadness come over mankind.  The best grew weary of their works.  A teaching went forth, a belief ran beside it: Everything is empty, everything is one, everything is past! And from every hill it resounded: Everything is empty, everything is one, everything is past! We have harvested, it is true: but why did all our fruits turn rotten and brown? What fell from the wicked moon last night? All our work has been in vain, our wine has become poison, an evil eye has scorched our fields and our hearts.  We have all become dry; and if fire fell upon us we should scatter like ashes – yes, we have made weary fire itself.  All our wells have dried up, even the sea has receded.  The earth wants to break open, but the depths will not devour us! Alas, where is there still a sea in which one could drown: thus our lament resounds – across shallow swamps.  Truly, we have grown too weary even to die; now we are still awake and we live on – in sepulchres!’ Thus did Zarathustra hear a prophet speak; 21 and his prophecy went to Zarathustra’s heart and transformed him.  He went about sad and weary; and he became like those of whom the prophet had spoken.  ‘Truly,’ he said to his disciples, ‘this long twilight is very nearly upon us.  Alas, how shall I preserve my light through it? ‘May it not be smothered in this sadness! It is meant to be a light to more distant worlds and to the most distant nights!’ Zarathustra went about grieving thus in his heart; and for three days he took no food or drink, had no rest and forgot speech.  At length it happened that he fell into a deep sleep.  And his disciples sat around him in the long watches of the night and waited anxiously to see if he would awaken and speak again and be cured of his affliction.  And this is the discourse that Zarathustra spoke when he awoke; his voice, however, came to his disciples as if from a great distance: Listen to the dream which I dreamed, friends, and help me to read its meaning! It is still a riddle to me, this dream; its meaning is hidden within it and imprisoned and does not yet fly above it with unconfined wings.  I dreamed I had renounced all life.  I had become a night-watchman and grave-watchman yonder upon the lonely hill-fortress of death.  Up there I guarded death’s coffins: the musty vaults stood full of these symbols of death’s victory.  Life overcome regarded me from glass coffins.  I breathed the odour of dust-covered eternities: my soul lay sultry and dust-covered.  And who could have ventilated his soul there? Brightness of midnight was all around me, solitude crouched beside it; and, as a third, the rasping silence of death, the worst of my companions.  I carried keys, the rustiest of all keys; and I could open with them the most creaking of all doors.  When the wings of this door were opened, the sound ran through the long corridors like an evil croaking; this bird cried out ill-temperedly, it did not want to be awakened.  But it was even more fearful and heart-tightening when it again became silent and still all around and I sat alone in that malignant silence.  So did time pass with me and creep past, if time still existed: what did I know of it I But at last occurred that which awakened me.  Three blows were struck on the door like thunderbolts, the vault resounded and roared three times again: then I went to the door.  Alpa! I cried, who is bearing his ashes to the mountain? Alpa! Alpa! Who is bearing his ashes to the mountain? And I turned the key and tugged at the door and exerted myself.  But it did not open by so much as a finger’s breadth: Then a raging wind tore the door asunder: whistling, shrilling and piercing it threw to me a black coffin: And in the roaring and whistling and shrilling, the coffin burst asunder and vomited forth a thousand peals of laughter.  And from a thousand masks of children, angels, owls, fools, and child-sized butterflies it laughed and mocked and roared at me.  This terrified me dreadfully: it prostrated me.  And I shrieked with horror as I had never shrieked before.  But my own shrieking awoke me – and I came to myself.  Thus Zarathustra narrated his dream and then fell silent: for he did not yet know the interpretation of his dream.  But the disciple whom he loved most arose quickly, grasped Zarathustra’s hand, and said: Your life itself interprets to us this dream, O Zarathustra! Are you yourself not the wind with a shrill whistling that tears open the doors of the fortress of death? Are you yourself not the coffin full of motley wickednesses and angel-masks of life? Truly, Zarathustra comes into all sepulchres like a thousand peals of children’s laughter, laughing at these night-watchmen and grave-watchmen, and whoever else rattles gloomy keys.  You will terrify and overthrow them with your laughter; fainting and reawakening will demonstrate your power over them.  And even when the long twilight and the weariness unto death appears, you will not set in our heaven, you advocate of life! You have shown us new stars and new glories of the night; truly, you have spread out laughter itself above us like a motley canopy.  Henceforth laughter of children will always issue from coffins; henceforth a strong wind will always come, victorious, to all weariness unto death: of that you yourself are our guarantee and prophet! Truly, you have dreamed your enemies themselves : that was your most oppressive dream! But as you awoke from them and came to yourself, so shall they awake from themselves – and come to you! Thus spoke the disciple; and all the others then pressed around Zarathustra and grasped his hands and sought to persuade him to leave his bed and his sadness and return to them.  But Zarathustra sat upon his bed erect and with an absent expression.  Like one who has returned home after being long in a strange land did he look upon his disciples and examine their faces; and as yet he did not recognize them.  But when they raised him and set him upon his feet, behold, his eye was suddenly transformed; he understood everything that had happened, stroked his beard, and said in a firm voice: Well now! This has had its time; but see to it, my disciples, that we have a good meal, and quickly! Thus I mean to do penance for bad dreams! The prophet, however, shall eat and drink beside me: and truly, I will yet show him a sea in which he can drown! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Then, however, he gazed long into the face of the disciple who had interpreted the dream, and shook his head.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra On the Blissful Islands T HE figs are falling from the trees, they are fine and sweet; and as they fall their red skins split.  I am a north wind to ripe figs.  Thus, like figs, do these teachings fall to you, my friends: now drink their juice and eat their sweet flesh! It is autumn all around and clear sky and afternoon.  Behold, what abundance is around us! And it is fine to gaze out upon distant seas from the midst of superfluity.  Once you said ‘God’ when you gazed upon distant seas; but now I have taught you to say ‘Superman’.  God is a supposition; but I want your supposing to teach no further than your creating will.  Could you create a god? – So be silent about all gods! But you could surely create the Superman.  Perhaps not you yourselves, my brothers! But you could transform yourselves into forefathers and ancestors of the Superman: and let this be your finest creating! God is a supposition: but I want your supposing to be bounded by conceivability.  Could you conceive a god? – But may the will to truth mean this to you: that everything shall be transformed into the humanly-conceivable, the humanly-evident, the humanly-palpable! You should follow your own senses to the end! And you yourselves should create what you have hitherto called the World: the World should be formed in your image by your reason, your will, and your love! And truly, it will be to your happiness, you enlightened men! And how should you endure life without this hope, you enlightened men? Neither in the incomprehensible nor in the irrational can you be at home.  But to reveal my heart entirely to you, friends: if there were gods, how could I endure not to be a god! Therefore there are no gods.  I, indeed, drew that conclusion; but now it draws me.  God is a supposition: but who could imbibe all the anguish of this supposition without dying? Shall the creator be robbed of his faith and the eagle of his soaring into the heights? God is a thought that makes all that is straight crooked and all that stands giddy.  What? Would time be gone and all that is transitory only a lie? To think this is giddiness and vertigo to the human frame, and vomiting to the stomach: truly, I call it the giddy sickness to suppose such a thing.  I call it evil and misanthropic, all this teaching about the one and the perfect and the unmoved and the sufficient and the intransitory.  All that is intransitory – that is but an image! 14 And the poets lie too much.  But the best images and parables should speak of time and becoming: they should be a eulogy and a justification of all transitoriness.  Creation – that is the great redemption from suffering, and life’s easement.  But that the creator may exist, that itself requires suffering and much transformation.  Yes, there must be much bitter dying in your life, you creators! Thus you are advocates and justifiers of all transitoriness.  For the creator himself to be the child new-born he must also be willing to be the mother and endure the mother’s pain.  Truly, I have gone my way through a hundred souls and through a hundred cradles and birth-pangs.  I have taken many departures, I know the heart-breaking last hours.  But my creative will, my destiny, wants it so.  Or, to speak more honestly: my will wants precisely such a destiny.  All feeling suffers in me and is in prison: but my willing always comes to me as my liberator and bringer of joy.  Willing liberates: that is the true doctrine of will and freedom – thus Zarathustra teaches you.  No more to will and no more to evaluate and no more to create! ah, that this great lassitude may ever stay far from me! In knowing and understanding, too, I feel only my will’s delight in begetting and becoming; and if there be innocence in my knowledge it is because will to begetting is in it.  This will lured me away from God and gods; for what would there be to create if gods – existed! But again and again it drives me to mankind, my ardent, creative will; thus it drives the hammer to the stone.  Ah, you men, I see an image sleeping in the stone, the image of my visions! Ah, that it must sleep in the hardest, ugliest stone! Now my hammer rages fiercely against its prison.  Fragments fly from the stone: what is that to me? I will complete it: for a shadow came to me – the most silent, the lightest of all things once came to me! The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow.  Ah, my brothers! What are the gods to me now! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Convalescent 1 O NE morning, not long after his return to the cave, Zarathustra sprang up from his bed like a madman, cried with a terrible voice, and behaved as if someone else were lying on the bed and would not rise from it; and Zarathustra’s voice rang out in such a way that his animals came to him in terror and from all the caves and hiding-places in the neighbourhood of Zarathustra’s cave all the creatures slipped away, flying, fluttering, creeping, jumping, according to the kind of foot or wing each had been given.  Zarathustra, however, spoke these words: Up, abysmal thought, up from my depths! I am your cockerel and dawn, sleepy worm: up! up! My voice shall soon crow you awake! Loosen the fetters of your ears: listen! For I want to hear you! Up! Up! Here is thunder enough to make even the graves listen! And wipe the sleep and all the dimness and blindness from your eyes! Hear me with your eyes, too: my voice is a medicine even for those born blind.  And once you are awake you shall stay awake for ever.  It is not my way to awaken great-grandmothers from sleep in order to bid them – go back to sleep! 39 Are you moving, stretching, rattling? Up! Up! You shall not rattle, you shall – speak to me! Zarathustra the Godless calls you! I, Zarathustra, the advocate of life, the advocate of suffering, the advocate of the circle – I call you, my most abysmal thought! Ah! you are coming – I hear you! My abyss speaks , I have turned my ultimate depth into the light! Ah! Come here! Give me your hand – ha! don’t! Ha, ha! – Disgust, disgust, disgust – woe is me! 2 Hardly had Zarathustra spoken these words, however, when he fell down like a dead man and remained like a dead man for a long time.  But when he again came to himself, he was pale and trembling and remained lying down and for a long time would neither eat nor drink.  This condition lasted seven days; his animals, however, did not leave him by day or night, except that the eagle flew off to fetch food.  And whatever he had collected and fetched he laid upon Zarathustra’s bed: so that at last Zarathustra lay among yellow and red berries, grapes, rosy apples, sweet-smelling herbs and pine-cones.  At his feet, however, two lambs were spread, which the eagle had, with difficulty, carried off from their shepherd.  At last, after seven days, Zarathustra raised himself in his bed, took a rosy apple in his hand, smelt it, and found its odour pleasant.  Then his animals thought the time had come to speak with him.  ‘O Zarathustra,’ they said, ‘now you have lain like that seven days, with heavy eyes: will you not now get to your feet again? ‘Step out of your cave: the world awaits you like a garden.  The wind is laden with heavy fragrance that longs for you; and all the brooks would like to run after you.  ‘All things long for you, since you have been alone seven days – step out of your cave! All things want to be your physicians! ‘Has perhaps a new knowledge come to you, a bitter, oppressive knowledge? You have lain like leavened dough, your soul has risen and overflowed its brim.’ ‘O my animals,’ answered Zarathustra, ‘go on talking and let me listen! Your talking is such refreshment: where there is talking, the world is like a garden to me.  How sweet it is, that words and sounds of music exist: are words and music not rainbows and seeming bridges between things eternally separated? ‘Every soul is a world of its own; for every soul every other soul is an afterworld.  ‘Appearance lies most beautifully among the most alike; for the smallest gap is the most difficult to bridge.  ‘For me – how could there be an outside-of-me? There is no outside! But we forget that, when we hear music; how sweet it is, that we forget! ‘Are things not given names and musical sounds, so that man may refresh himself with things? Speech is a beautiful foolery: with it man dances over all things.  ‘How sweet is all speech and all the falsehoods of music! With music does our love dance upon many-coloured rainbows.’ ‘O Zarathustra,’ said the animals then, ‘all things themselves dance for such as think as we: they come and offer their hand and laugh and flee – and return.  ‘Everything goes, everything returns; the wheel of existence rolls for ever.  Everything dies, everything blossoms anew; the year of existence runs on for ever.  ‘Everything breaks, everything is joined anew; the same house of existence builds itself for ever.  Everything departs, everything meets again; the ring of existence is true to itself for ever.  ‘Existence begins in every instant; the ball There rolls around every Here.  The middle is everywhere.  The path of eternity is crooked.’ ‘O you buffoons and barrel-organs!’ answered Zarathustra and smiled again;’ how well you know what had to be fulfilled in seven days: ‘and how that monster crept into my throat and choked me! But I bit its head off and spat it away.  ‘And you – have already made a hurdy-gurdy song of it? I, however, lie here now, still weary from this biting and spitting away, still sick with my own redemption.  ‘And you looked on at it all? O my animals, are you, too, cruel? Did you desire to be spectators of my great pain, as men do? For man is the cruellest animal.  ‘More than anything on earth he enjoys tragedies, bullfights, and crucifixions; and when he invented Hell for himself, behold, it was his heaven on earth.  ‘When the great man cries out, straightway the little man comes running; his tongue is hanging from his mouth with lasciviousness.  He, however, calls it his “pity”.  ‘The little man, especially the poet – how zealously he accuses life in words! Listen to it, but do not overlook the delight that is in all accusation! ‘Such accusers of life: life overcomes them with a glance of its eye.  “Do you love me?” it says impudently; “just wait a little, I have no time for you yet.” ‘Man is the cruellest animal towards himself; and with all who call themselves “sinners” and “bearers of the Cross” and “penitents” do not overlook the sensual pleasure that is in this complaint and accusation! ‘And I myself- do I want to be the accuser of man? Ah, my animals, this alone have I learned, that the wickedest in man is necessary for the best in him, ‘that all that is most wicked in him is his best strength and the hardest stone for the highest creator; and that man must grow better and wickeder: ‘To know: Man is wicked; that was to be tied to no torture-stake – but I cried as no one had cried before: ‘“Alas, that his wickedest is so very small! Alas, that his best is so very small!” ‘The great disgust at man – it choked me and had crept into my throat: and what the prophet prophesied: “It is all one, nothing is worth while, knowledge chokes.” ‘A long twilight limps in front of me, a mortally-weary, death-intoxicated sadness which speaks with a yawn.  ‘“The man of whom you are weary, the little man, recurs eternally” – thus my sadness yawned and dragged its feet and could not fall asleep.  ‘The human earth became to me a cave, its chest caved in, everything living became to me human decay and bones and mouldering past.  ‘My sighs sat upon all the graves of man and could no longer rise; my sighs and questions croaked and choked and gnawed and wailed by day and night: ‘“Alas, man recurs eternally! The little man recurs eternally!” ‘I had seen them both naked, the greatest man and the smallest man: all too similar to one another, even the greatest all too human! ‘The greatest all too small! – that was my disgust at man I And eternal recurrence even for the smallest! that was my disgust at all existence! ‘Ah, disgust! Disgust! Disgust!’ Thus spoke Zarathustra and sighed and shuddered; for he remembered his sickness.  But his animals would not let him speak further.  ‘Speak no further, convalescent!’ – thus his animals answered him, ‘but go out to where the world awaits you like a garden.  ‘Go out to the roses and bees and flocks of doves! But go out especially to the song-birds, so that you may learn singing from them! ‘For convalescents should sing; let the healthy talk.  And when the healthy man, too, desires song, he desires other songs than the convalescent.’ ‘O you buffoons and barrel-organs, do be quiet!’ answered Zarathustra and smiled at his animals.  ‘How well you know what comfort I devised for myself in seven days! ‘That I have to sing again – that comfort and this convalescence did I devise for myself: do you want to make another hurdy-gurdy song out of that, too?’ ‘Speak no further,’ his animals answered once more; ‘rather first prepare yourself a lyre, convalescent, a new lyre! ‘For behold, O Zarathustra! New lyres are needed for your new songs.  ‘Sing and bubble over, O Zarathustra, heal your soul with new songs, so that you may bear your great destiny, that was never yet the destiny of any man! ‘For your animals well know, O Zarathustra, who you are and must become: behold, you are the teacher of the eternal recurrence , that is now your destiny! ‘That you have to be the first to teach this doctrine – how should this great destiny not also be your greatest danger and sickness! ‘Behold, we know what you teach: that all things recur eternally and we ourselves with them, and that we have already existed an infinite number of times before and all things with us.  ‘You teach that there is a great year of becoming, a colossus of a year: this year must, like an hour-glass, turn itself over again and again, so that it may run down and run out anew: ‘so that all these years resemble one another, in the greatest things and in the smallest, so that we ourselves resemble ourselves in each great year, in the greatest things and in the smallest.  ‘And if you should die now, O Zarathustra: behold, we know too what you would then say to yourself – but your animals ask you not to die yet! ‘You would say – and without trembling, but rather gasping for happiness: for a great weight and oppression would have been lifted from you, most patient of men! ‘“Now I die and decay,” you would say, “and in an instant I shall be nothingness.  Souls are as mortal as bodies.  “‘But the complex of causes in which I am entangled will recur – it will create me again! I myself am part of these causes of the eternal recurrence.  “‘I shall return, with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this serpent – not to a new life or a better life or a similar life: “‘I shall return eternally to this identical and self-same life, in the greatest things and in the smallest, to teach once more the eternal recurrence of all things, ‘“to speak once more the teaching of the great noontide of earth and man, to tell man of the Superman once more.  ‘“I spoke my teaching, I broke upon my teaching: thus my eternal fate will have it – as prophet do I perish! ‘“Now the hour has come when he who is going down shall bless himself.  Thus – ends Zarathustra’s down-going.’” When the animals had spoken these words they fell silent and expected that Zarathustra would say something to them: but Zarathustra did not hear that they were silent.  On the contrary, he lay still with closed eyes like a sleeper, although he was not asleep: for he was conversing with his soul.  The serpent and the eagle, however, when they found him thus silent, respected the great stillness around him and discreetly withdrew.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Sorcerer 1 W HEN Zarathustra had turned the corner around a rock, however, he saw not far below him on the same pathway a man who was throwing his arms about as if in a frenzy and who finally hurled himself to earth flat on his belly.  ‘Stop!’ said Zarathustra then to his heart, ‘he yonder must surely be the Higher Man, that evil cry of distress came from him – I will see if he can be helped.’ But when he ran to the spot where the man lay on the ground, he found a trembling old man with staring eyes; and however much Zarathustra tried to raise him and set him upon his legs, it was in vain.  Neither did the unfortunate man seem to notice that there was anyone with him; on the contrary, he continually looked around him with pathetic gestures, like one forsaken by and isolated from all the world.  Eventually, however, after much trembling, quivering, and self-contortion, he began to wail thus: Who still warms me, who still loves me? Offer me hot hands! Offer me coal-warmers for the heart! Spread-eagled, shuddering, Like a half-dead man whose feet are warmed – Shaken, alas! by unknown fevers, Trembling with sharp icy frost-arrows, Pursued by you, my thought! Unutterable, veiled, terrible one! Huntsman behind the clouds! Struck down by your lightning-bolt, You mocking eye that stares at me from the darkness – thus I lie, Bend myself, twist myself, tortured By every eternal torment, Smitten By you, cruel huntsman, You unknown – God! Strike deeper! Strike once again! Sting and sting, shatter this heart! What means this torment With blunt arrows? Why do you look down, Unwearied of human pain, With malicious divine flashing eyes? Will you not kill, Only torment, torment? Why – torment me , You malicious, unknown God? Ha ha! Are you stealing near? At such a midnight hour What do you want? Speak! You oppress me, press me – Ha! far too closely! Away! Away! You hear me breathing, You overhear my heart, You jealous God – Yet, jealous of what? Away! Away! Why the ladder? Would you climb Into my heart, Climb into my most secret Thoughts? Shameless, unknown – thief! What would you get by stealing? What would you get by listening? What would you get by torturing, You torturer? You – Hangman-god! Or shall I, like a dog, Roll before you? Surrendering, raving with rapture, Wag – love to you? In vain! Strike again, Cruellest knife! No, Not dog – I am only your game, Cruellest huntsman! Your proudest prisoner, You robber behind the clouds! For the last time, speak! What do you want, way layer, from me? You God veiled in lightning! Unknown One! Speak, What do you want, unknown – God? What? Ransom? How much ransom? Demand much – thus speaks my pride! And be brief – thus speaks my other pride! Ha ha! Me – you want me? Me – all of me?… Ha ha! And you torment me, fool that you are, You rack my pride? Offer me love – who still warms me? Who still loves me? – offer me hot hands! Offer me coal-warmers for the heart, Offer me, the most solitary, Whom ice, alas! sevenfold ice Has taught to long for enemies, For enemies themselves, Offer, yes yield to me, Cruellest enemy – Yourself ! He is gone! He himself has fled, My last, sole companion, My great enemy, My unknown, My Hangman-god! No! Come back, With all your torments! Oh come back To the last of all solitaries! All the streams of my tears Run their course to you! And the last flame of my heart – It burns up to you ! Oh come back, My unknown God! My pain! My last – happiness! 2 At this point, however, Zarathustra could restrain himself no longer; he took his stick and struck the wailing man with all his force.  ‘Stop!’ he shouted at him with furious laughter, ‘stop, you actor! You fabricator! You liar from the heart! I know you well! ‘I will warm your legs for you, you evil sorcerer, I well know how to make things warm for such as you!’ ‘Leave off,’ said the old man and jumped up from the ground, ‘beat me no more, O Zarathustra! I was doing it only in fun! ‘Such things are part of my art; I wanted to put you yourself to the proof when I gave you this exhibition! 42 And truly, you have seen well through me! ‘But you, too, have given me no small proof of yourself: you are hard , you wise Zarathustra! You strike hard with your “truths”, your cudgel forced from me – this truth!’ ‘Do not flatter,’ answered Zarathustra, still excited and frowning,’ you actor from the heart! You are false: why speak – of truth! ‘You peacock of peacocks, you ocean of vanity, what did you play before me, you evil sorcerer, in whom was I supposed to believe when you wailed in such a fashion?’ ‘ The penitent of the spirit ,’ said the old man, ‘it was he I played: you yourself once invented this expression – the poet and sorcerer who at last turns his spirit against himself, the transformed man who freezes through his bad knowledge and bad conscience.  ‘And just confess it: it took a long time, O Zarathustra, for you to see through my trick and lie! You believed in my distress when you took my head in your hands, ‘I heard you wail: “He has been too little loved, too little loved!” My wickedness rejoiced within me that I had deceived you so far.’ ‘You may have deceived subtler men than me,’ said Zarathustra severely.  ‘I am not on my guard against deceivers, I must be without caution: so my fate will have it.  ‘You, however, must deceive: I know you so far.  You must always be ambiguous, with two, three, four, five meanings! And what you just confessed was not nearly true enough and not nearly false enough for me! ‘You evil fabricator, how could you do otherwise! You would even deck your disease if you showed yourself naked to your physician.  ‘Thus you decked your lie before me when you said “I was doing it only in fun!” There was also earnestness in it, you are something of a penitent of the spirit! ‘I have divined you well: you have become the enchanter of everyone, but against yourself you have no lie and no cunning left – you are disenchanted with yourself! ‘You have reaped disgust as your single truth.  With you, no word is genuine any more, but your mouth is genuine: that is, the disgust that clings to your mouth.’ ‘But who are you!’ the old sorcerer cried at this point in a defiant voice, ‘who dares to speak like this to me , the greatest man, living today?’ – and a green lightning-flash shot from his eye at Zarathustra.  But immediately he changed and said sadly: ‘O Zarathustra, I am tired of it, my arts disgust me, I am not great , why do I pretend! But, you know it well – I sought greatness! ‘I wanted to appear a great man and I convinced many: but this lie has been beyond my strength.  I am collapsing under it.  ‘O Zarathustra, everything about me is a lie; but that I am collapsing – this is genuine !’ ‘It honours you,’ said Zarathustra gloomily, casting down his eyes, ‘it honours you that you sought greatness, but it also betrays you.  You are not great.  ‘You evil old sorcerer, this is the best and most honest thing that I honour in you, that you have grown weary of yourself and have declared “I am not great”.  ‘In that do I honour you as a penitent of the spirit: and, if only for a passing breath, in this one moment you were – genuine.  ‘But say, what do you seek here among my forests and cliffs? And when you laid yourself in my path, what proof did you want of me? ‘What did you test me in?’ Thus spoke Zarathustra and his eyes sparkled.  The old sorcerer was silent for a time, then he said: ‘Did I test you? I – only seek.  ‘O Zarathustra, I seek a genuine man, a proper, simple man, a man of one meaning and of all honesty, a repository of wisdom, a saint of knowledge, a great man! ‘For do you not know, O Zarathustra? I seek Zarathustra .’ And at this point a long silence arose between the two; Zarathustra, however, became deeply absorbed, so that he closed his eyes.  Then, however, returning to his companion, he grasped the sorcerer’s hand and said, with much politeness and guile: ‘Very well! Up yonder leads the way to where Zarathustra’s cave lies.  You may seek there him you wish to find.  ‘And ask advice of my animals, my eagle and my serpent: they shall help you seek.  But my cave is big.  ‘I myself, to be sure – I have never yet seen a great man.  The eye of the subtlest is crude today for what is great.  It is the kingdom of the mob.  ‘I have found so many who stretched and inflated themselves, and the people cried: “Behold a great man!” But what good are all bellows! The wind escapes from them at last.  ‘A frog that has blown itself out too long explodes at last: then the wind escapes.  To prick the belly of a puffed-up windbag I call a fine sport.  Hear that, lads! ‘Today belongs to the mob: who still knows what is great, what small! Who could successfully seek greatness there! Only a fool: a fool would succeed.  ‘Do you seek great men, you strange fool? Who taught you to? Is today the time for it? Oh, you evil seeker, why – do you tempt 43 me?’ Thus spoke Zarathustra, comforted at heart, and continued, laughing, on his way.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Love of One’s Neighbour Y OU crowd together with your neighbours and have beautiful words for it.  But I tell you: Your love of your neighbour is your bad love of yourselves.  You flee to your neighbour away from yourselves and would like to make a virtue of it: but I see through your ‘selflessness’.  The ‘You’ is older than the ‘I’; the ‘You’ has been consecrated, but not yet the ‘I’: so man crowds towards his neighbour.  Do I exhort you to love of your neighbour? I exhort you rather to flight from your neighbour and to love of the most distant! 11 Higher than love of one’s neighbour stands love of the most distant man and of the man of the future; higher still than love of man! account love of causes and of phantoms.  This phantom that runs along behind you, my brother, is fairer than you; why do you not give it your flesh and bones? But you are afraid and you run to your neighbour.  You cannot endure to be alone with yourselves and do not love yourselves enough: now you want to mislead your neighbour into love and gild yourselves with his mistake.  I wish rather that you could not endure to be with any kind of neighbour or with your neighbour’s neighbour; then you would have to create your friend and his overflowing heart out of yourselves.  You invite in a witness when you want to speak well of yourselves; and when you have misled him into thinking well of you, you then think well of yourselves.  It is not only he who speaks contrary to what he knows who lies, but even more he who speaks contrary to what he does not know.  And thus you speak of yourselves in your dealings with others and deceive your neighbour with yourselves.  Thus speaks the fool: ‘Mixing with people ruins the character, especially when one has none.’ One man runs to his neighbour because he is looking for himself, and another because he wants to lose himself.  Your bad love of yourselves makes solitude a prison to you.  It is the distant man who pays for your love of your neighbour; and when there are five of you together, a sixth always has to die.  I do not like your festivals, either: I have found too many actors there, and the audience, too, behaved like actors.  I do not teach you the neighbour but the friend.  May the friend be to you a festival of the earth and a foretaste of the Superman.  I teach you the friend and his overflowing heart.  But you must understand how to be a sponge if you want to be loved by overflowing hearts.  I teach you the friend in whom the world stands complete, a vessel of the good – the creative friend, who always has a complete world to bestow.  And as the world once dispersed for him, so it comes back to him again, as the evolution of good through evil, as the evolution of design from chance.  May the future and the most distant be the principle of your today: in your friend you should love the Superman as your principle.  My brothers, I do not exhort you to love of your neighbour: I exhort you to love of the most distant.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Way of the Creator M Y brother, do you want to go apart and be alone? Do you want to seek the way to yourself? Pause just a moment and listen to me.  ‘He who seeks may easily get lost himself.  It is a crime to go apart and be alone’ – thus speaks the herd.  The voice of the herd will still ring within you.  And when you say: ‘We have no longer the same conscience, you and I’, it will be a lament and a grief.  For see, it is still this same conscience that causes your grief: and the last glimmer of this conscience still glows in your affliction.  But you want to go the way of your affliction, which is the way to yourself? If so, show me your strength for it and your right to it! Are you a new strength and a new right? A first motion? A self-propelling wheel? Can you also compel stars to revolve about you? Alas, there is so much lusting for eminence! There is so much convulsion of the ambitious! Show me that you are not one of the lustful or ambitious! Alas, there are so many great ideas that do no more than a bellows: they inflate and make emptier.  Do you call yourself free? I want to hear your ruling idea, and not that you have escaped from a yoke.  Are you such a man as ought to escape a yoke? There are many who threw off their final worth when they threw off their bondage.  Free from what? Zarathustra does not care about that! But your eye should clearly tell me: free for what? Can you furnish yourself with your own good and evil and hang up your own will above yourself as a law? Can you be judge of yourself and avenger of your law? It is terrible to be alone with the judge and avenger of one’s own law.  It is to be like a star thrown forth into empty space and into the icy breath of solitude.  Today you still suffer from the many, O man set apart: today you still have your courage whole and your hopes.  But one day solitude will make you weary, one day your pride will bend and your courage break.  One day you will cry: ‘I am alone!’ One day you will no longer see what is exalted in you; and what is base in you, you will see all too closely; your sublimity itself will make you afraid, as if it were a phantom.  One day you will cry: ‘Everything is false!’ There are emotions that seek to kill the solitary; if they do not succeed, well, they must die themselves! But are you capable of being a murderer? My brother, have you ever known the word ‘contempt’? And the anguish of your justice in being just to those who despise you? You compel many to change their opinion about you; they hold that very much against you.  You approached them and yet went on past them: that they will never forgive you.  You go above and beyond them: but the higher you climb, the smaller you appear to the eye of envy.  And he who flies is hated most of all.  ‘How could you be just towards me?’ – that is how you must speak – ‘I choose your injustice as my portion.’ They throw injustice and dirt at the solitary: but, my brother, if you want to be a star, you must shine none the less brightly for them on that account! And be on your guard against the good and just! They would like to crucify those who devise their own virtue -they hate the solitary.  Be on your guard, too, against holy simplicity! Everything which is not simple is unholy to it: and it, too, likes to play, with fire – in this case, the fire of the stake.  And be on your guard, too, against the assaults your love makes upon you! The solitary extends his hand too quickly to anyone he meets.  To many men, you ought not to give your hand, but only your paw 12 : and I should like it if your paw had claws, too.  But you yourself will always be the worst enemy you can encounter; you yourself lie in wait for yourself in caves and forests.  Solitary man, you are going the way to yourself! And your way leads past yourself and your seven devils! You will be a heretic to yourself and a witch and a prophet and an evil-doer and a villain.  You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame: how could you become new, if you had not first become ashes? Solitary man, you are going the way of the creator: you want to create yourself a god from your seven devils! Solitary man, you are going the way of the lover: you love yourself and for that reason you despise yourself as only lovers can despise.  The lover wants to create, because he despises! What does he know of love who has not had to despise precisely what he loved? Go apart and be alone with your love and your creating, my brother; and justice will be slow to limp after you.  Go apart and be alone with my tears, my brother.  I love him who wants to create beyond himself, and thus perishes.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Leech A ND Zarathustra walked thoughtfully farther and deeper through forests and past swampy places; but, as happens with those who think on difficult things, on his way he unintentionally trod on a man.  And behold, all at once a cry of pain and two curses and twenty little invectives spurted up into his face: so that in his fright he raised his stick and brought it down on the man he had trodden on.  But he immediately came to his senses; and his heart laughed at the folly he had just committed.  ‘Forgive me,’ he said to the man he had trodden on, who had angrily risen and sat down again, ‘forgive me and first of all accept a parable.  ‘How a wanderer dreaming of distant things unintentionally stumbles over a dog on a lonely road, a dog lying in the sun: ‘how they both start up and let fly at one another like mortal enemies, these two, frightened to death: thus it happened with us.  ‘And yet! And yet – how little was lacking for them to caress one another, this dog and this solitary! For they are both- solitaries!’ ‘Whoever you may be,’ said the trodden-on man, still angry, ‘you have come too near me with your parable and not only with your foot! ‘For look, am I a dog?’ – and thereupon the sitting man arose and drew his naked arm from the swamp.  For previously he had lain stretched out on the ground, concealed and unrecognizable, like someone lying in wait for swamp game.  ‘But what are you doing!’ cried Zarathustra in alarm, for he saw that a great deal of blood was running down the naked arm, ‘what has happened to you? Has an evil beast bitten you, unhappy man?’ The bleeding man laughed, still irritated.  ‘What is it to do with you!’ he said, and made to go off.  ‘Here I am at home and in my domain.  Whoever wants to question me, let him: but I shall hardly reply to a blockhead!’ ‘You are wrong,’ said Zarathustra compassionately, and held him fast, ‘you are wrong: here you are not in your own home but in my kingdom, and I will have no one come to harm here.  ‘But none the less, call me what you like – I am what I must be.  I call myself Zarathustra.  ‘Very well! Up yonder leads the way to Zarathustra’s cave: it is not far – will you not tend your wounds in my home? ‘Things have gone ill with you in this life, you unhappy man: first a beast bit you, and then – a man trod on you!’ But when the trodden-on man heard the name of Zarathustra, he changed.  ‘What has happened to me!’ he cried; ‘who concerns me in this life except this one man, Zarathustra, and that one beast that lives on blood, the leech? ‘For the sake of the leech I have lain here beside this swamp like a fisherman, and already my outstretched arm has been bitten ten times; now a fairer leech bites for my blood, Zarathustra himself! ‘Oh happiness! Oh wonder! Praised be this day, that lured me to this swamp! Praised be the best, liveliest cupping-glass alive today, praised be the great leech of conscience, Zarathustra!’ Thus spoke the man who had been trodden on; and Zarathustra rejoiced at his words and their fine, respectful manner.  ‘Who are you?’ he asked, and offered him his hand, ‘between us there is still much to elucidate and dear up: but already, it seems to me, it is bright, broad daylight.’ ‘I am the conscientious man of the spirit ,’ answered the other, ‘and scarcely anyone is sterner, stricter, and more severe in things of the spirit than I, apart from him from whom I learned, Zarathustra himself.  ‘Better to know nothing than half-know many things! Better to be a fool on one’s own account than a wise man at the approval of others! I – go to the root of things: ‘what matter if it be great or small? If it be swamp or sky? A hand’s breadth of ground is enough for me: if only it be thoroughly firm ground! ‘a hand’s breadth of ground: one can stand upon that.  In truly conscientious knowledge there is nothing great and nothing small.’ ‘So perhaps you are an expert on the leech?’ asked Zarathustra.  ‘And do you probe the leech down to its ultimate roots, conscientious man?’ ‘O Zarathustra,’ answered the man who was trodden on, ‘that would be a colossal task, how could I undertake it! ‘But what I am master of and expert on is the leech’s brain – that is my world! ‘And that too is a world! But forgive me that my pride here speaks out, for here I have not my equal.  That is why I said “Here I am at home”.  ‘How long have I probed this one thing, the brain of the leech, so that slippery truth should here no longer slip away from me! Here is my kingdom! ‘For its sake I have cast away all others, for its sake I have grown indifferent to all others; and close beside my knowledge couches my black ignorance.  ‘The conscience of my spirit demands of me that I know one thing and apart from that know nothing: I am disgusted by all the semi-intellectual, all the vaporous, hovering, visionary.  ‘Where my honesty ceases I am blind and want to be blind.  But where I want to know I also want to be honest, that is, severe, stern, strict, cruel, inexorable.  ‘Because you , O Zarathustra, once said: “Spirit is the life that itself cuts into life”, that led and seduced me to your teaching.  And truly, with my own blood have I increased my own knowledge!’ ‘As the evidence indicates,’ Zarathustra interposed; for blood continued to run down the naked arm of the man of conscience.  For ten leeches had bitten into it.  ‘Oh you strange fellow, how much this evidence tells me, for it tells me about yourself! And perhaps I could not pour all of it into your stern ears! ‘Very well! Let us part here! But I should like to meet you again.  Up yonder leads the way to my cave: tonight you shall there be my welcome guest! ‘And I should also like to make amends to your body for treading upon you: I shall think about that.  But now a cry of distress calls me hurriedly away from you.’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Old and New Law – Tables 1 H ERE I sit and wait, old shattered law-tables around me and also new, half-written law-tables.  When will my hour come? – the hour of my down-going, my descent: for I want to go to men once more.  For that I now wait: for first the sign that it is my hour must come to me – namely, the laughing lion with the flock of doves.  Meanwhile I talk to myself, as one who has plenty of time.  No one tells me anything new; so I tell myself to myself.  2 When I visited men, I found them sitting upon an old self-conceit.  Each one thought he had long since known what was good and evil for man.  All talk of virtue seemed to them an ancient wearied affair; and he who wished to sleep well spoke of ‘good’ and ‘evil’ before retiring.  I disturbed this somnolence when I taught that nobody yet knows what is good and evil – unless it be the creator! But he it is who creates a goal for mankind and gives the earth its meaning and its future: he it is who creates the quality of good and evil in things.  And I bade them overturn their old professorial chairs, and wherever that old self-conceit had sat.  I bade them laugh at their great masters of virtue and saints and poets and world-redeemers.  I bade them laugh at their gloomy sages, and whoever had sat as a black scarecrow, cautioning, on the tree of life.  I sat myself on their great grave-street, and even beside carrion and vultures – and I laughed over all their ‘past’ and its decayed expiring glory.  Truly, like Lenten preachers and fools did I cry anger and shame over all their great and small things – their best is so very small! Their worst is so very small! – thus I laughed.  Thus from out of me cried and laughed my wise desire, which was born on the mountains, a wild wisdom, in truth! – my great desire with rushing wings.  And often it tore me forth and up and away and in the midst of laughter: and then indeed I flew, an arrow, quivering with sun-intoxicated rapture: out into the distant future, which no dream has yet seen, into warmer Souths than artists have ever dreamed of, there where gods, dancing, are ashamed of all clothes – so that I might speak in parables, and hobble and stutter like poets: and truly, I am ashamed that I still have to be a poet! Where all becoming seemed to me the dancing of gods and the wantonness of gods, and the world unrestrained and abandoned and fleeing back to itself – as many gods eternally fleeing and re-seeking one another, as many gods blissfully self-contradicting, communing again and belonging again to one another – Where all time seemed to me a blissful mockery of moments, where necessity was freedom itself, which blissfully played with the goad of freedom – Where I found again my old devil and arch-enemy, the Spirit of Gravity, and all that he created: compulsion, dogma, need and consequence and purpose and will and good and evil: For must there not exist that which is danced upon , danced across? Must there not be moles and heavy dwarfs – for the sake of the nimble, the nimblest? 3 There it was too that I picked up the word ‘Superman’ and that man is something that must be overcome, that man is a bridge and not a goal; counting himself happy for his noontides and evenings, as a way to new dawns: Zarathustra’s saying of the great noontide, and what ever else I have hung up over men, like a purple evening afterglow.  Truly, I showed them new stars, together with new nights – and over cloud and day and night I spread out laughter like a coloured canopy.  I taught them all my art and aims: to compose into one and bring together what is fragment and riddle and dreadful chance in man – as poet, reader of riddles, and redeemer of chance, I taught them to create the future, and to redeem by creating – all that was past .  To redeem that past of mankind and to transform every ‘It was’, until the will says: ‘But I willed it thus! So shall I will it-’ this did I call redemption, this alone did I teach them to call redemption.  Now I await my redemption – that I may go to them for the last time.  For I want to go to man once more: I want to go under among them, I want to give them, dying, my richest gift! From the sun when it goes down, that superabundant star, I learned this: then, from inexhaustible riches it pours out gold into the sea – so that the poorest fisherman rows with golden oars! For once I saw this, and did not tire of weeping to see it.  Like the sun, Zarathustra also wants to go down: now he sits here and waits, old shattered law-tables around him and also new law-tables – half-written.  4 Behold, here is a new law-table: but where are my brothers, to bear it with me to the valley and to fleshly hearts? Thus commands my great love for the most distant men: Do not spare your neighbour! Man is something that must be overcome.  There are diverse paths and ways to overcoming: just look to it! But only a buffoon thinks: ‘Man can also jumped over ’.  Overcome yourself even in your neighbour: and a right that you can seize for yourself you should not accept as a gift! What you do, no one can do to you.  Behold, there is no requital.  He who cannot command himself should obey.  And many a one can command himself but be very remiss in obeying what he commands! 5 This is the will of those of noble soul: they desire nothing gratis , least of all life.  He who is of the mob wants to live gratis; we others, however, to whom life has given itself- we are always considering what we can best give in return ! And truly, it is a noble speech that says: ‘What life has promised us, we shall keep that promise – to life!’ One should not wish to enjoy where one has not given enjoyment.  And – one should not wish to enjoy! For enjoyment and innocence are the most modest things: neither want to be looked for.  One should have them – but one should look rather for guilt and pain! 6 O my brothers, he who is a first-born is always sacrificed.  Now we are first-born.  We all bleed at secret sacrificial tables, we all burn and roast to the honour of ancient idols.  Our best is still young: this excites old palates.  Our flesh is tender, our skin is only a lamb-skin: – how should we not excite old idol-priests! He still lives on in us ourselves , the old idol-priest, who roasts our best for his feast.  Alas, my brothers, how should the firstborn not be sacrifices! But our kind will have it thus; and I love those who do not wish to preserve themselves.  I love with my whole love those who go down and perish: for they are going beyond.  7 To be truthful – few can do it! And those who can, will not! Least of all, however, can the good be truthful.  Oh these good men! Good men never tell the truth; to be good in that way is a sickness of the spirit.  They yield, these good men, they acquiesce, their hearts imitate, they obey from the heart: but he who obeys does not listen to himself ! All that the good call evil must come together that one truth may be born: O my brothers, are you, too, evil enough for this truth? The bold attempt, prolonged mistrust, the cruel No, satiety, the cutting into die living – how seldom do these come together! But from such seed is – truth raised.  Hitherto all knowledge has grown up beside the bad conscience! Shatter, you enlightened men, shatter the old law-tables! 8 When water is planked over so that it can be walked upon, when gangway and railings span the stream: truly, he is not believed who says: ‘Everything is in flux.’ 33 On the contrary, even simpletons contradict him.  ‘What?’ say the simpletons, ‘everything in flux? But there are planks and railings over the stream! ‘Over the stream everything is firmly fixed, all the values of things, the bridges, concepts, all “Good” and “Evil”: all are firmly fixed !’ But when hard winter comes, the animal-tamer of streams, then even the cleverest learn mistrust; and truly, not only the simpletons say then: ‘Is not everything meant to – stand still?’ ‘Fundamentally, everything stands still’ – that is a proper winter doctrine, a fine thing for unfruitful seasons, a fine consolation for hibernators and stay at-homes.  ‘Fundamentally, everything stands still’ – the thawing wind, however, preaches to the contrary ! The thawing wind, an ox that is no ploughing ox – a raging ox, a destroyer that breaks ice with its angry horns! Ice, however – breaks gangways ! O my brothers, is everything not now in flux? Have not all railings and gangways fallen into the water and come to nothing? Who can still cling to ‘good’ and ‘evil’? ‘Woe to us! Hail to us! The thawing wind is blowing!’ – Preach thus, O my brothers, through every street! 9 There is an old delusion that is called good and evil.  Up to now, this delusion has orbited about prophets and astrologers.  Once people believed in prophets and astrologers: and therefore people believed: ‘Everything is fate: you shall, for you must!’ Then again people mistrusted all prophets and astrologers: and therefore people believed: ‘Everything is freedom: you can, for you will!’ O my brothers, up to now there has been only supposition, not knowledge, concerning the stars and the future: and therefore there has hitherto been only supposition, not knowledge, concerning good and evil! 10 ‘You shall not steal! You shall not kill!’ – such words were once called holy; in their presence people bowed their knees and their heads and removed their shoes.  But I ask you: Where have there ever been better thieves and killers in the world than such holy words have been? Is there not in all life itself- stealing and killing? And when such words were called holy was not truth itself – killed? Or was it a sermon of death that called holy that which contradicted and opposed all life? – O my brothers, shatter, shatter the old law-tables! 11 My pity for all that is past is that I see: It has been handed over – handed over to the favour, the spirit, the madness of every generation that comes and transforms everything that has been into its own bridge! A great despot could come, a shrewd devil, who with his favour and disfavour could compel and constrain all that is past, until it became his bridge and prognostic and herald and cock-crow.  This, however, is the other danger and my other pity: he who is of the mob remembers back to his grandfather – with his grandfather, however, time stops.  Thus all that is past is handed over: for the mob could one day become master, and all time be drowned in shallow waters.  Therefore, O my brothers, is a new nobility needed: to oppose all mob-rule and all despotism and to write anew upon new law-tables the word: ‘Noble’.  For many noblemen are needed, and noblemen of many kinds, for nobility to exist ! Or, as I once said in a parable: ‘Precisely this is godliness, that there are gods but no God!’ 12 O my brothers, I direct and consecrate you to a new nobility: you shall become begetters and cultivators and sowers of the future – truly, not to a nobility that you could buy like shopkeepers with shopkeepers’ gold: for all that has a price is of little value.  Let where you are going, not where you come from, henceforth be your honour I Your will and your foot that desires to step out beyond you – let them be your new honour! Truly, not that you have served a prince – of what account are princes now! – or have become a bulwark to that which stands, that it may stand more firmly! Not that your family have grown courtly at courts and you have learned to stand for long hours in shallow pools, motley-coloured like a flamingo: for being able to stand is a merit with courtiers; and all courtiers believe that part of the bliss after death is – being allowed to sit! And not that a ghost, called holy, led your ancestors into promised lands that I do not praise: for in the land where the worst of all trees, the Cross, grew – there is nothing to praise! – and truly, wherever this ‘Holy Ghost’ led its knights, goats and geese and Cross-eyed and wrong-headed fellows always – ran at the bead of the procession! O my brothers, your nobility shall not gaze backward, but outward ! You shall be fugitives from all fatherlands and fore-fatherlands! You shall love your children’s land : let this love be your new nobility – the undiscovered land in the furthest sea! I bid your sails seek it and seek it! You shall make amends to your children for being the children of your fathers: thus you shall redeem all that is past I This new law-table do I put over you! 13 ‘Wherefore live? All is vanity! To live – that means to thrash straw; to live – that means to burn oneself and yet not become warm.’ Ancient rigmarole like this still counts as ‘wisdom’; and it is the more honoured because it is old and smells damp.  Even mould ennobles.  Children might speak in this way: they shrink from the fire because it has burned them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.  And how should he who is always ‘thrashing straw’ be allowed to slander thrashing! Such a fool would have to have his mouth stopped! Such people sit down to dinner and bring nothing with them, not even a good appetite – and now they say slanderously: ‘All is vanity!’ But to eat and drink well, O my brothers, is truly no vain art! Shatter, shatter the law-tables of the never-joyful! 14 ‘To the pure all things are pure’ – thus speaks the people.  But I say to you: To the swine all things become swinish! That is why the fanatics and hypocrites with bowed heads whose hearts too are bowed down preach: ‘The world itself is a filthy monster.’ For they all have an unclean spirit; but especially those who have no peace or rest except they see the world from behind – these afterworldsmen! I tell these to their faces, although it does not sound pleasant: The world resembles man in that it has a behind – so much is true! There is much filth in the world: so much is true! But the world itself is not yet a filthy monster on that account! There is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smells ill: disgust itself creates wings and water-divining powers! Even in the best there is something to excite disgust; and even the best is something that must be overcome! O my brothers, there is much wisdom in the fact that there is much filth in the world! 15 These sayings I heard pious afterworldsmen say to their consciences, and truly without deceit or falsehood, although there is nothing more false or deceitful in the world.  ‘Let the world be! Do not raise even a finger against it!’ ‘Let him who wants to slaughter and kill and harass and swindle the people: do not raise even a finger against it! Thus they will yet learn to renounce the world.’ ‘And your own reason – you shall yourself choke and throttle; for it is a reason of this world – thus you shall yourself learn to renounce the world.’ Shatter, O my brothers, shatter these ancient law-tables of the pious! Shatter by your teachings the sayings of the world-calumniators! 16 ‘He who learns much, unlearns all violent desiring’ – people whisper that to one another today in all dark streets.  ‘Wisdom makes weary, nothing is worth while; you shall not desire!’ – I found this new law-table hanging even in public market-places.  Shatter, O my brothers, shatter this new law-table too! The world-weary and the preachers of death hung it up, and so did the jailers: for behold, it is also a sermon urging slavery: They have learned badly and the best things not at all, they have learned everything too early and too fast: they have eaten badly – that is how they got that stomach-ache – for their spirit is stomach-ache: it counsels death! For truly, my brothers, the spirit is a stomach! Life is a fountain of delight: but all wells are poisoned for him from whom an aching stomach, the father of affliction, speaks.  To know: that is delight to the lion-willed! But he who has grown weary is only ‘willed’, he is the sport of every wave.  And that is always the nature of weak men: they lose themselves on their way.  And at last their weariness asks: ‘Why have we ever taken any way? It is a matter of indifference!’ It sounds pleasant to their ears when it is preached: ‘Nothing is worth while! You shall not will!’ This, however, is a sermon urging slavery.  O my brothers, Zarathustra comes as a fresh, blustering wind to all the way-weary; he will yet make many noses sneeze! My liberal breath blows even through walls and into prisons and imprisoned spirits! Willing liberates: for willing is creating: thus I teach.  And you should learn only for creating! And you should first learn from me even how to learn, how to learn well! – He who has ears to hear, let him hear! 17 There stands the boat – over there is perhaps the way to the great Nothingness.  But who wants to step into this ‘perhaps’? None of you wants to step into the death-boat! How then could you be world-weary? World-weary! And you have not yet even parted from the earth!! have always found you still greedy for the earth, still in love with your own weariness of the earth! Your lip does not hang down in vain – a little earthly wish still sits upon it I And in your eye – does not a little cloud of unforgotten earthly joy swim there? There are many excellent inventions on earth, some useful, some pleasant: the earth is to be loved for their sake.  And there are many things so well devised that they are like women’s breasts: at the same time useful and pleasant.  But you world-weary people! You should be given a stroke of the cane! Your legs should be made sprightly again with cane-strokes! For: if you are not invalids and worn-out wretches of whom the earth is weary, you are sly sluggards or dainty, sneaking lust-cats.  And if you will not again run about merrily, you shall – pass away! One should not want to be physician to the incurable: thus Zarathustra teaches: so you shall pass away! But to make an end requires more courage than to make a new verse: all physicians and poets know that.  18 O my brothers, there are law-tables framed by weariness and law-tables framed by laziness, indolent laziness: although they speak similarly they want to be heard differently.  Look here at this languishing man! He is only an inch from his goal, but from weariness he has laid himself defiantly here in the dust: this valiant man! He yawns from weariness at the path and the earth and the goal and at himself: he refuses to take another step – this valiant man! Now the sun burns down upon him and the dogs lick his sweat: but he lies there in his defiance and prefers to languish – to languish an inch from his goal! Truly, he will have to be pulled into his heaven by the hair – this hero! Better to leave him lying where he has laid himself, so that sleep, the comforter, may come to him with cooling, murmuring rain: Let him lie until he awakes of his own accord, until of his own accord he disavows all weariness and what weariness has taught through him! Only, my brothers, scare away the dogs from him, the indolent skulkers, and all the swarming vermin – all the swarming ‘cultured’ vermin who feast upon the sweat of every hero! 19 I form circles and holy boundaries around myself; fewer and fewer climb with me upon higher and higher mountains: I build a mountain-range out of holier and holier mountains.  But wherever you would climb with me, O my brothers, see to it that we parasite climbs with you! Parasite: that is a worm, a creeping, supple worm, that wants to grow fat on your sick, sore places.  And it is its art to divine the weary spots in climbing souls: it builds its loathsome nest in your grief and dejection, in your tender modesty.  Where the strong man is weak, where the noble man is too gentle, there it builds its loathsome nest: the parasite dwells where the great man possesses little sore places.  Which is the highest type of being and which the lowest? The parasite is the lowest type; but he who is of the highest type nourishes the most parasites.  For the soul which possesses the longest ladder and can descend the deepest: how should the most parasites not sit upon it? the most spacious soul, which can run and stray and roam the farthest into itself; the most necessary soul, which out of joy hurls itself into chance – the existing soul which plunges into becoming; the possessing soul which wants to partake in desire and longing – the soul fleeing from itself which retrieves itself in the widest sphere; the wisest soul, to which foolishness speaks sweetest – the soul that loves itself the most, in which all things have their current and counter-current and ebb and flow: – oh how should the highest soul not possess the worst parasites? 20 O my brothers, am I then cruel? But I say: That which is falling should also be pushed! Everything of today – it is falling, it is decaying: who would support it? But I – want to push it too! Do you know the delight that rolls stones into precipitous depths? – These men of today: just see how they roll into my depths! I am a prologue to better players, O my brothers! An example! 34 Follow my example! And him you do not teach to fly, teach – to fallfaster ! 21 I love the brave: but it is not enough to be a swordsman, one must also know against whom to be a swordsman! And there is often more bravery in containing oneself and passing by: in order to spare oneself for a worthier enemy! You should have enemies whom you hate but not enemies whom you despise: you must be proud of your enemy: thus I taught once before.  You should spare yourselves, O my friends, for a worthier enemy: therefore you must pass many things by, especially must you pass by many of the rabble who din in your ears about people and peoples.  Keep your eye clear of their For and Against! There is much right, much wrong in it: whoever looks on grows angry.  To look in, to weigh in – that comes to the same thing in this case: therefore go off into the forests and lay your sword to sleep! Go your ways! And let people and peoples go theirs! – dark ways, to be sure, on which not one hope lightens any longer! Let the shopkeeper rule where everything that still glisters is – shopkeeper’s gold! The age of kings is past: what today calls itself the people deserves no king.  Just see how these people themselves now behave like shopkeepers: they glean the smallest advantage from sweepings of every kind.  They lie in wait for one another, they wheedle things out of one another – they call that ‘good neighbourliness’.  Oh blessed, distant time when a people said to itself: ‘I want to be – master over peoples!’ For, my brothers: the best shall rule, the best wants to rule! And where it is taught differently, there – the best is lacking .  22 If they – had bread for nothing, alas! – what would they cry for! Their maintenance – that is their proper entertainment; 35 and life shall be hard for them! They are beasts of prey: even in their ‘working’ – there is robbery, even in their’ earning’ – there is fraud! Therefore life shall be hard for them! Thus they shall become finer beasts of prey, subtler, cleverer, more man-like beasts of prey: for man is the finest beast of prey.  Man has already robbed all beasts of their virtues: that is why, of all beasts, life is the hardest for man.  Only the birds are still beyond him.  And if man should learn to fly, alas I to what height – would his rapaciousness fly! 23 This is how I would have man and woman: the one fit for war, the other fit for bearing children, but both fit for dancing with head and heels.  And let that day be lost to us on which we did not dance once! And let that wisdom be false to us that brought no laughter with it! 24 Your marriage-contracting: see it is not a bad contracting .  You have decided too quickly: from that follows – break up of marriage.  36 And yet rather break up of marriage than bending of marriage, lying in marriage! – A woman said to me: ‘True, I broke up my marriage, but first my marriage – broke me up!’ I have always found the badly-paired to be the most revengeful: they make everybody suffer for the fact that they are no longer single.  For that reason I want honest people to say to one another: ‘We love each other: let us see to it that we stay in love! Or shall our promise be a mistake? 37 ‘Allow us a term and a little marriage, to see if we are fit for the great marriage! It is a big thing always to be with another!’ Thus I counsel all honest people; and what would be my love for the Superman and for everything to come if I should counsel and speak otherwise! To propagate yourselves, not only forward but upward – may the garden of marriage assist you, O my brothers! 25 He who has grown wise concerning old origins, behold, he will at last seek new springs of the future and new origins.  O my brothers, it will not be long before new peoples shall arise and new springs rush down into new depths.  For the earthquake – that blocks many wells and causes much thirst – also brings to light inner powers and secret things.  The earthquake reveals new springs.  In the earthquake of ancient peoples new springs break forth.  And around him who cries: ‘Behold here a well for many who are thirsty, one heart for many who long, one will for many instruments’ – around him assembles a people , that is to say: many experimenters.  Who can command, who can obey – that is experimented here ! Alas, with what protracted searching and succeeding, and failing and learning and experimenting anew! Human society: that is an experiment, so I teach – a long search: 38 it seeks, however, the commander! – an experiment, O my brothers I And not a ‘contract’ I Shatter, shatter that expression of the soft-hearted and half-and-half! 26 O my brothers! With whom does the greatest danger for the whole human future lie? Is it not with the good and just?– with those who say and feel in their hearts: ‘We already know what is good and just, we possess it too; woe to those who are still searching for it!’ And whatever harm the wicked may do, the harm the good do is the most harmful harm! And whatever harm the world-calumniators may do, the harm the good do is the most harmful harm.  O my brothers, someone who once looked into the heart of the good and just said: ‘They are the Pharisees.’ But he was not understood.  The good and just themselves could not understand him: their spirit is imprisoned in their good conscience.  The stupidity of the good is unfathomably clever.  But it is the truth: the good have to be Pharisees – they have no choice! The good have to crucify him who devises his own virtue! That is the truth! But the second man to discover their country, the country, heart, and soil of the good and just, was he who asked:’ Whom do they hate the most?’ They hate the creator most: him who breaks the law-tables and the old values, the breaker – they call him the law-breaker.  For the good – cannot create: they are always the beginning of the end:– they crucify him who writes new values on new law-tables, they sacrifice the future to themselves – they crucify the whole human future! The good – have always been the beginning of the end.  27 O my brothers, have you understood this saying, too? And what I once said about the ‘Ultimate Man’? With whom does the greatest danger to the whole human future lie? Is it not with the good and just? Shatter, shatter the good and just! – O my brothers, have you understood this saying, too? 28 Do you flee from me? Are you frightened? Do you tremble at this saying? O my brothers, when I bade you shatter the good and the law-tables of the good, only then did I embark mankind upon its high seas.  And only now does the great terror, the great prospect, the great sickness, the great disgust, the great sea-sickness come to it.  The good taught you false shores and false securities; you were born and kept in the lies of the good.  Everything has been distorted and twisted down to its very bottom through the good.  But he who discovered the country of ‘Man’, also discovered the country of ‘Human Future’.  Now you shall be seafarers, brave, patient seafarers! Stand up straight in good time, O my brothers, learn to stand up straight! The sea is stormy: many want to straighten themselves again by your aid.  The sea is stormy: everything is at sea.  Well then! Come on, you old seaman-hearts! What of fatherland! Our helm wants to fare away , out to where our children’s land is! Out, away, more stormy than the sea, storms our great longing! 29 ‘Why so hard?’ the charcoal once said to the diamond; ‘for are we not close relations?’ Why so soft? O my brothers, thus I ask you: for are you not – my brothers? Why so soft, so unresisting and yielding? Why is there so much denial and abnegation in your hearts? So little fate in your glances? And if you will not be fates, if you will not be inexorable: how can you – conquer with me? And if your hardness will not flash and cut and cut to pieces: how can you one day – create with me? For creators are hard.  And it must seem bliss to you to press your hand upon millennia as upon wax, bliss to write upon the will of millennia as upon metal – harder than metal, nobler than metal.  Only the noblest is perfectly hard.  This new law-table do I put over you, O my brothers: Become hard ! 30 O my Will! My essential, my necessity, dispeller of need! Preserve me from all petty victories! O my soul’s predestination, which I call destiny! In-me! Over-me! Preserve and spare me for a great destiny! And your last greatness, my Will, save for your last – that you may be inexorable in your victory! Ah, who has not succumbed to his own victory! Ah, whose eye has not dimmed in this intoxicated twilight! Ah, whose foot has not stumbled and in victory forgotten – how to stand! That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noontide: ready and ripe like glowing ore, like cloud heavy with lightning and like swelling milk-udder – ready for myself and my most secret Will: a bow eager for its arrow, an arrow eager for its star – a star, ready and ripe in its noontide, glowing, transpierced, blissful through annihilating sun-arrows – a sun itself and an inexorable sun-will, ready for annihilation in victory! O Will, my essential, my necessity, dispeller of need! Spare me for one great victory! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Compassionate M Y friends, your friend has heard a satirical saying: ‘Just look at Zarathustra! Does he not go among us as if among animals?’ But it is better said like this: ‘The enlightened man goes among men as among animals.’ The enlightened man calls man himself: the animal with red cheeks.  How did this happen to man? Is it not because he has had to be ashamed too often? Oh my friends! Thus speaks the enlightened man: ‘Shame, shame, shame – that is the history of man!’ And for that reason the noble man resolves not to make others ashamed: he resolves to feel shame before all sufferers.  Truly, I do not like them, the compassionate who are happy in their compassion: they are too lacking in shame.  If I must be compassionate I still do not want to be called compassionate; and if I am compassionate then it is preferably from a distance.  And I should also prefer to cover my head and flee away before I am recogni2ed: and thus I bid you do, my friends! May my destiny ever lead across my path only those who, like you, do not sorrow or suffer, and those with whom I can have hope and repast and honey in common! Truly, I did this and that for the afflicted; but it always seemed to me I did better things when I learned to enjoy myself better.  As long as men have existed, man has enjoyed himself too little: that alone, my brothers, is our original sin! And if we learn better to enjoy ourselves, we best unlearn how to do harm to others and to contrive harm.  Therefore I wash my hand when it has helped a sufferer, therefore I wipe my soul clean as well.  For I saw the sufferer suffer, and because I saw it I was ashamed on account of his shame; and when I helped him, then I sorely injured his pride.  Great obligations do not make a man grateful, they make him resentful; and if a small kindness is not forgotten it becomes a gnawing worm.  ‘Be reserved in accepting! Honour a man by accepting from him!’ – thus I advise those who have nothing to give.  I, however, am a giver: I give gladly as a friend to friends.  But strangers and the poor may pluck the fruit from my tree for themselves: it causes less shame that way.  Beggars, however, should be entirely abolished! Truly, it is annoying to give to them and annoying not to give to them.  And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: stings of conscience teach one to sting.  But worst of all are petty thoughts.  Truly, better even to have done wickedly than to have thought pettily! To be sure, you will say: ‘Delight in petty wickedness spares us many a great evil deed.’ But here one should not wish to be spared.  The evil deed is like a boil: it itches and irritates and breaks forth – it speaks honourably.  ‘Behold, I am disease’ – thus speaks the evil deed; that is its honesty.  But the petty thought is like a canker: it creeps and hides and wants to appear nowhere – until the whole body is rotten and withered by little cankers.  But I whisper this advice in the ear of him possessed of a devil: ‘Better for you to rear your devil! There is a way to greatness even for you!’ Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about everybody! And many a one who has become transparent to us is still for a long time invulnerable.  It is hard to live with men, because keeping silent is so hard.  And we are the most unfair, not towards him whom we do not like, but towards him for whom we feel nothing at all.  But if you have a suffering friend, be a resting-place for his suffering, but a resting-place like a hard bed, a camp-bed: thus you will serve him best.  And should your friend do you a wrong, then say: ‘I forgive you what you did to me; but that you did it to yourself – how could I forgive that?’ Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.  One should hold fast to one’s heart; for if one lets it go, how soon one loses one’s head, too! Alas, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the compassionate? And what in the world has caused more suffering than the follies of the compassionate? Woe to all lovers who cannot surmount pity! Thus spoke the Devil to me once: ‘Even God has his Hell: it is his love for man.’ And I lately heard him say these words: ‘God is dead; God has died of his pity for man.’ So be warned against pity: thence shall yet come a heavy cloud for man! Truly, I understand weather-signs! But mark, too, this saying: All great love is above pity: for it wants – to create what is loved! ‘I offer myself to my love, and my neighbour as myself ’ – that is the language of all creators.  All creators, however, are hard.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Great Events T HERE is an island in the sea – not far from the Blissful Islands of Zarathustra – upon which a volcano continually smokes; the people, and especially the old women among the people, say that it is placed like a block of stone before the gate of the underworld, but that the narrow downward path which leads to this gate of the underworld passes through the volcano itself.  Now at the time Zarathustra was living on the Blissful Islands it happened that a ship dropped anchor at the island upon which the smoking mountain stood; and its crew landed in order to shoot rabbits.  Towards the hour of noon, however, when the captain and his men were reassembled, they suddenly saw a man coming towards them through the air, and a voice said clearly: ‘It is time! It is high time!’ But as the figure was closest to them – it flew quickly past, however, like a shadow, in the direction of the volcano – they recognized, with the greatest consternation, that it was Zarathustra; for all of them had seen him before, except the captain himself, and they loved him as the people love: that is, with love and awe in equal parts.  ‘Just look!’ said the old steersman, ‘there is Zarathustra going to Hell!’ At the same time as these sailors landed on the volcano island, the rumour went around that Zarathustra had disappeared; and when his friends were questioned, they said that he had gone aboard a ship by night without saying where he intended to sail.  Thus there arose a disquiet; after three days, however, there was added to this disquiet the story of the sailors – and then all the people said that the Devil had carried Zarathustra off.  Of course, his disciples laughed at this talk; and one of them even said: ‘I would rather believe that Zarathustra had carried off the Devil.’ But at the bottom of their souls they were all full of apprehension and longing: so great was their joy when, on the fifth day, Zarathustra appeared among them.  And this is the tale of Zarathustra’s conversation with the fire-dog: The earth (he said) has a skin; and this skin has diseases.  One of these diseases, for example, is called ‘Man’.  And another of these diseases is called ‘the fire-dog’: men have told many lies and been told many lies about him .  To fathom this secret I fared across the sea: and I have seen truth naked, truly! barefoot to the neck.  Now I know all about the fire-dog; and also about all the revolutionary and subversive devils which not only old women fear.  ‘Up with you, fire-dog, up from your depth!’ I cried, ‘and confess how deep that depth is! Where does it come from, that which you snort up? ‘You drink deeply from the sea: your bitter eloquence betrays that! Truly, for a dog of the depths you take your food too much from the surface! ‘At the best, I hold you to be the earth’s ventriloquist: and when I have heard subversive and revolutionary devils speak, I have always found them like you: bitter, lying, and superficial.  ‘You understand how to bellow and how to darken the air with ashes! You are the greatest braggart and have sufficiently learned the art of making mud boil.  ‘Where you are there must always be mud around and much that is spongy, hollow, and compressed: it wants to be freed.  ‘“Freedom”, you all most like to bellow: but I have unlearned belief in “great events” whenever there is much bellowing and smoke about them.  ‘And believe me, friend Infernal-racket! The greatest events – they are not our noisiest but our stillest hours.  ‘The world revolves, not around the inventors of new noises, but around the inventors of new values; it revolves inaudibly .  ‘And just confess! Little was ever found to have happened when your noise and smoke dispersed.  What did it matter that a town had been mummified and a statue lay in the mud! ‘And I say this to the overthrowers of statues: To throw salt into the sea and statues into the mud are perhaps the greatest of follies.  ‘The statue lay in the mud of your contempt: but this precisely is its law, that its life and living beauty grow again out of contempt! ‘And now it arises again, with diviner features and sorrowfully-seductive; and in truth! it will even thank you for overthrowing it, you overthrowers! ‘I tender, however, this advice to kings and churches and to all that is weak with age and virtue – only let yourselves be overthrown! That you may return to life, and that virtue – may return to you!’ Thus I spoke before the fire-dog: then he interrupted me sullenly and asked: ‘The church? What is that then?’ ‘The church?’ I answered.  ‘The church is kind of state, and indeed the most mendacious kind.  But keep quiet, you hypocrite dog! You surely know your own kind best! ‘Like you, the state is a hypocrite dog; like you, it likes to speak with smoke and bellowing – to make believe, like you, that it speaks out of the belly of things.  ‘For the state wants to be absolutely the most important beast on earth; and it is believed to be so, too!’ When I said that, the fire-dog acted as if he were mad with envy.  ‘What?’ he cried, ‘the most important beast on earth? And it is believed to be so, too?’ And so much steam and hideous shrieking came from his throat I thought he would choke with vexation and envy.  At length he grew quieter and his panting ceased; as soon as he was quiet, however, I said laughing; ‘You are vexed, fire-dog: therefore I am right about you! ‘And that I may press my point, let me speak of another fire-dog, which really speaks from the heart of the earth.  ‘His breath exhales gold and golden rain: so his heart will have it.  What are ashes and smoke and hot mud to him now! ‘Laughter flutters from him like a motley cloud; he is ill-disposed towards your gurgling and spitting and griping of the bowels! ‘Gold and laughter, however, he takes from the heart of the earth: for, that you may know it – the heart of the earth is of gold .  ’ When the fire-dog heard this he could no longer bear to listen to me.  Abashed, he drew in his tail, said ‘Bow-wow’ in a small voice and crawled down into his cave.  Thus narrated Zarathustra.  But his disciples hardly listened to him, so great was their desire to tell him about the sailors, the rabbits, and the flying man.  ‘What am I to think of it?’ said Zarathustra.  ‘Am I then a ghost? ‘But it will have been my shadow.  Surely you have heard something of the Wanderer and his Shadow? 20 ‘This, however, is certain: I must keep it under stricter control – otherwise it will ruin my reputation.’ And once again Zarathustra shook his head and wondered.  ‘What am I to think of it?’ he said again.  ‘Why, then, did the phantom cry: “It is time! It is high time!”? ‘ For what , then, is it – high time?’ Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra ZARATHUSTRA’S DISCOURSES Of the Three Metamorphoses I NAME you three metamorphoses of the spirit: how the spirit shall become a camel, and the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.  There are many heavy things for the spirit, for the strong, weight-bearing spirit in which dwell respect and awe: its strength longs for the heavy, for the heaviest.  What is heavy? thus asks the weight-bearing spirit, thus it kneels down like the camel and wants to be well laden.  What is the heaviest thing, you heroes? so asks the weight-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.  Is it not this: to debase yourself in order to injure your pride? To let your folly shine out in order to mock your wisdom? Or is it this: to desert our cause when it is celebrating its victory? To climb high mountains in order to tempt the tempter? Or is it this: to feed upon the acorns and grass of knowledge and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of the soul? Or is it this: to be sick and to send away comforters and make friends with the deaf, who never hear what you ask? Or is it this: to wade into dirty water when it is the water of truth, and not to disdain cold frogs and hot toads? Or is it this: to love those who despise us and to offer our hand to the ghost when it wants to frighten us? The weight-bearing spirit takes upon itself all these heaviest things: like a camel hurrying laden into the desert, thus it hurries into its desert.  But in the loneliest desert the second metamorphosis occurs: the spirit here becomes a lion; it wants to capture freedom and be lord in its own desert.  It seeks here its ultimate lord: it will be an enemy to him and to its ultimate God, it will struggle for victory with the great dragon.  What is the great dragon which the spirit no longer wants to call lord and God? The great dragon is called ‘Thou shalt’.  But the spirit of the lion says ‘I will!’ ‘Thou shalt’ lies in its path, sparkling with gold, a scale-covered beast, and on every scale glitters golden ‘Thou shalt’.  Values of a thousand years glitter on the scales, and thus speaks the mightiest of all dragons: ‘All the values of things – glitter on me.  ‘All values have already been created, and all created values – are in me.  Truly, there shall be no more “I will”!’ Thus speaks the dragon.  My brothers, why is the lion needed in the spirit? Why does the beast of burden, that renounces and is reverent, not suffice? To create new values – even the lion is incapable of that: but to create itself freedom for new creation – that the might of the lion can do.  To create freedom for itself and a sacred No even to duty: the lion is needed for that, my brothers.  To seize the right to new values – that is the most terrible proceeding for a weight-bearing and reverential spirit Truly, to this spirit it is a theft and a work for an animal of prey.  Once it loved this ‘Thou shalt’ as its holiest thing: now it has to find illusion and caprice even in the holiest, that it may steal freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this theft.  But tell me, my brothers, what can the child do that even the lion cannot? Why must the preying lion still become a child? The child is innocence and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a sport, a self-propelling wheel, a first motion, a sacred Yes.  Yes, a sacred Yes is needed, my brothers, for the sport of creation: the spirit now wills its own will, the spirit sundered from the world now wins its own world.  I have named you three metamorphoses of the spirit: how the spirit became a camel, and the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  And at that time he was living in the town called The Pied Cow.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Voluntary Death M ANY die too late and some die too early.  Still the doctrine sounds strange: ‘Die at the right time.’ Die at the right time: thus Zarathustra teaches.  To be sure, he who never lived at the right time could hardly die at the right time! Better if he were never to be born! – Thus I advise the superfluous.  But even the superfluous make a great thing of their dying; yes, even the hollowest nut wants to be cracked.  Everyone treats death as an important matter: but as yet death is not a festival.  As yet, men have not learned to consecrate the fairest festivals.  I shall show you the consummating death, which shall be a spur and a promise to the living.  The man consummating his life dies his death triumphantly, surrounded by men filled with hope and making solemn vows.  Thus one should learn to die; and there should be no festivals at which such a dying man does not consecrate the oaths of the living! To die thus is the best death; but the second best is: to die in battle and to squander a great soul.  But equally hateful to the fighter as to the victor is your grinning death, which comes creeping up like a thief – and yet comes as master.  I commend to you my sort of death, voluntary death that comes to me because I wish it.  And when shall I wish it? – He who has a goal and an heir wants death at the time most favourable to his goal and his heir.  And out of reverence for his goal and his heir he will hang up no more withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life.  Truly, I do not want to be like the rope-makers: they spin out their yarn and as a result continually go backwards themselves.  Many a one grows too old even for his truths and victories; a toothless mouth has no longer the right to every truth.  And everyone who wants glory must take leave of honour in good time and practise the difficult art of – going at the right time.  One must stop permitting oneself to be eaten when one tastes best: this is understood by those who want to be loved long.  To be sure, there are sour apples whose fate is to wait until the last day of autumn: and they become at the same time ripe, yellow, and shrivelled.  In some the heart ages first and in others the spirit.  And some are old in their youth: but those who are young late stay young long.  For many a man, life is a failure: a poison-worm eats at his heart.  So let him see to it that his death is all the more a success.  Many a man never becomes sweet, he rots even in the summer.  It is cowardice that keeps him fastened to his branch.  Many too many live and they hang on their branches much too long.  I wish a storm would come and shake all this rottenness and worm-eatenness from the tree! I wish preachers of speedy death would come! They would be the fitting storm and shakers of the trees of life! But I hear preached only slow death and patience with all ‘earthly things’.  Ah, do you preach patience with earthly things? It is these earthly things that have too much patience with you, you blasphemers! Truly, too early died that Hebrew whom the preachers of slow death honour: and that he died too early has since been a fatality for many.  As yet he knew only tears and the melancholy of the Hebrews, together with the hatred of the good and just -the Hebrew Jesus: then he was seized by the longing for death.  Had he only remained in the desert and far from the good and just! Perhaps he would have learned to live and learned to love the earth – and laughter as well! Believe it, my brothers! He died too early; he himself would have recanted his teaching had he lived to my age! He was noble enough to recant! But he was still immature.  The youth loves immaturely and immaturely too he hates man and the earth.  His heart and the wings of his spirit are still bound and heavy.  But there is more child in the man than in the youth, and less melancholy: he has a better understanding of life and death.  Free for death and free in death, one who solemnly says No when there is no longer time for Yes: thus he understands life and death.  That your death may not be a blasphemy against man and the earth, my friends: that is what I beg from the honey of your soul.  In your death, your spirit and your virtue should still glow like a sunset glow around the earth: otherwise yours is a bad death.  Thus I want to die myself, that you friends may love the earth more for my sake; and I want to become earth again, that I may have peace in her who bore me.  Truly, Zarathustra had a goal, he threw his ball: now may you friends be the heirs of my goal, I throw the golden ball to you.  But best of all I like to see you, too, throwing on the golden ball, my friends! So I shall stay on earth a little longer: forgive me for it! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Intoxicated Song 1 M EANWHILE, however, one after another had gone out into the open air and the cool, thoughtful night; but Zarathustra himself led the ugliest man by the hand, to show him his nocturnal world and the big, round moon and the silver waterfalls beside his cave.  There at last they stood silently together, just a group of old folk, but with comforted, brave hearts and amazed in themselves that it was so well with them on earth; but the mystery of the night drew nearer and nearer their hearts.  And Zarathustra thought to himself again: ‘Oh, how well they please me now, these Higher Men!’ – but he did not say it, for he respected their happiness and their silence.  Then, however, occurred the most astonishing thing in that long, astonishing day: the ugliest man began once more and for the last time to gurgle and snort, and when he at last came to the point of speech, behold, a question leaped round and pure from his mouth, a good, deep, clear question, which moved the hearts of all who heard it.  ‘My assembled friends,’ said the ugliest man, ‘what do you think? For the sake of this day – I am content for the first time to have lived my whole life.  ‘And it is not enough that I testify only this much.  It is worth while to live on earth: one day, one festival with Zarathustra has taught me to love the earth.  ‘“Was that – life?” I will say to death.  “Very well! Once more!”’ ‘My friends, what do you think? Will you not, like me, say to death: “Was that – life? For Zarathustra’s sake, very well! Once more!’ Thus spoke the ugliest man; and it was not long before midnight.  And what would you think then took place? As soon as the Higher Men had heard his question, they were all at once conscious of their transformation and recovery, and of who had given them these things: then they leaped towards Zarathustra, thanking, adoring, caressing, kissing his hands, each after his own fashion: so that some laughed, some wept.  The old prophet, however, danced with pleasure; and even if he was then full of sweet wine, as some narrators believe, he was certainly fuller still of sweet life and had renounced all weariness.  There are even those who tell that the ass danced at that time: for not in vain had the ugliest man given it wine to drink.  This may be the case, or it may be otherwise; and if in truth the ass did not dance that evening, greater and stranger marvels than the dancing of an ass occurred.  In brief, as Zarathustra’s saying has it: ‘What does it matter!’ 2 Zarathustra, however, when this incident with the ugliest man occurred, stood there like one intoxicated: his eyes grew dim, his tongue stammered, his feet tottered.  And who could divine what thoughts then passed over Zarathustra’s soul? But it seemed that his soul fell back and fled before him and was in remote distances and as if ‘upon a high ridge’, as it is written, ‘wandering like a heavy cloud between past and future.’ But gradually, while the Higher Men were holding him in their arms, he came to himself a little and his hands restrained the adoring and anxious throng; yet he did not speak.  All at once, however, he swiftly turned his head, for he seemed to hear something: then he laid a finger to his lips and said: ‘Come! ’ And at once it grew still and mysterious all around; from the depths, however, there slowly arose the sound of a bell.  Zarathustra listened to it, as the Higher Men did; then he laid a finger to his lips a second time and said again: ‘Come! Come! Midnight is coming on !’ and his voice had altered.  But still he did not move from his place: then it grew yet more still and mysterious, and everything listened, even the ass and Zarathustra’s animals of honour, the eagle and the serpent, likewise Zarathustra’s cave and the great, cool moon and the night itself.  Zarathustra, however, laid his hand to his lips for the third time and said: Come! Come! Come! Let us walk now! The hour has come: let us walk into the night ! 3 You Higher Men, midnight is coming on: so I will say something in your ears, as that old bell says it in my ear, as secretly, as fearfully, as warmly as that midnight-bell tells it to me, which has experienced more than one man: which has already counted your fathers’ painful heartbeats -ah! ah! how it sighs! how in dreams it laughs! the ancient, deep, deep midnight! Soft! Soft! Then many a thing can be heard which may not speak by day; but now, in the cool air, when all the clamour of your hearts, too, has grown still, now it speaks, now it is heard, now it creeps into nocturnal, over-wakeful souls: ah! ah! how it sighs! how in dreams it laughs! do you not hear, how secretly, fearfully, warmly it speaks to you, the ancient, deep, deep midnight? O Man! Attend ! 4 Woe is me! Where has time fled? Did I not sink into deep wells? The world is asleep Ah! Ah! The dog howls, the moon is shining.  I will rather die, die, than tell you what my midnight-heart is now thinking.  Now I am dead.  It is finished.  Spider, why do you spin your web around me? Do you want blood? Ah! Ah! The dew is falling, the hour has come – the hour which chills and freezes me, which asks and asks and asks: ‘Who has heart enough for it? ‘ – who shall be master of the world? Who will say: Thus shall you run, you great and small streams!’ – the hour approaches: O man, you Higher Man, attend! this discourse is for delicate ears, for your ears – what does deep midnight’s voice contend? 5 I am borne away, my soul dances.  The day’s task! The day’s task! Who shall be master of the world? The moon is cool, the wind falls silent.  Ah I Ah! Have you flown high enough? You dance: but a leg is not a wing.  You good dancers, now all joy is over: wine has become dregs, every cup has grown brittle, the graves mutter.  You have not flown high enough: now the graves mutter: ‘Redeem the dead! Why is it night so long? Does the moon not intoxicate us?’ You Higher Men, redeem the graves, awaken the corpses! Alas, why does the worm still burrow? The hour approaches, it approaches, the bell booms, the heart still drones, the woodworm, the heart’s worm, still burrows.  Alas! The world is deep ! 6 Sweet lyre! Sweet lyre! Your sound, your intoxicated, ominous sound, delights me! – from how long ago, from how far away does your sound come to me, from a far distance, from the pools of love! You ancient bell, you sweet lyre! Every pain has torn at your heart, the pain of a father, the pain of our fathers, the pain of our forefathers; your speech has grown ripe, ripe like golden autumn and afternoon, like my hermit’s heart – now you say: The world itself has grown ripe, the grapes grow brown, now they want to die, to die of happiness.  You Higher Men, do you not smell it? An odour is secretly welling up, a scent and odour of eternity, an odour of roseate bliss, a brown, golden wine odour of ancient happiness, of intoxicated midnight’s dying happiness, which sings: The world is deep: deeper than day can comprehend ! 7 Let me be! Let me be! I am too pure for you.  Do not touch me! Has my world not just become perfect? My skin is too pure for your hands.  Let me be, stupid, doltish, stifling day! Is midnight not brighter? The purest shall be master of the world; the least known, the strongest, the midnight souls, who are brighter and deeper than any day.  O day, do you grope for me? Do you feel for my happiness? Do you think me rich, solitary, a pit of treasure, a chamber of gold? O world, do you desire me? Do you think me worldly? Do you think me spiritual? Do you think me divine? But day and world, you are too clumsy, have cleverer hands, reach out for deeper happiness, for deeper unhappiness, reach out for some god, do not reach out for me: my unhappiness, my happiness is deep, you strange day, but yet I am no god, no divine Hell: deep is its woe , 8 God’s woe is deeper, you strange world I Reach out for God’s woe, not for me! What am I? An intoxicated, sweet lyre – a midnight lyre, a croaking bell which no one understands but which has to speak before deaf people, you Higher Men! For you do not understand me! Gone! Gone! Oh youth! Oh noontide! Oh afternoon! Now come evening and midnight; the dog howls, the wind: is the wind not a dog? It whines, it yelps, it howls.  Ah! Ah! how it sighs! how it laughs, how it rasps and gasps, the midnight hour! How it now speaks soberly, this intoxicated poet! perhaps it has overdrunk its drunkenness? perhaps it has grown over-wakeful? perhaps it ruminates? it ruminates upon its woe in dreams, the ancient, deep midnight hour, and still more upon its joy.  For joy, though woe be deep: Joy is deeper than heart’s agony .  9 You grape-vine! Why do you praise me? For I cut you! I am cruel, you bleed: what means your praise of my intoxicated cruelty? ‘What has become perfect, everything ripe – wants to die!’ thus you speak.  Blessed, blessed be the vine-knife! But everything unripe wants to live: alas! Woe says: ‘Fade! Be gone, woe!’ But everything that suffers wants to live, that it may grow ripe and merry and passionate, passionate for remoter, higher, brighter things.  ‘I want heirs,’ thus speaks everything that suffers, ‘I want children, I do not want myself .  ’ Joy, however, does not want heirs or children, joy wants itself, wants eternity, wants recurrence, wants everything eternally the same.  Woe says: ‘Break, bleed, heart! Walk, legs! Wings, fly! Upward! Upward, pain!’ Very well! Come on! my old heart: Woe says: Fade! Go ! 10 What do you think, you Higher Men? Am I a prophet? A dreamer? A drunkard? An interpreter of dreams? A midnight bell? A drop of dew? An odour and scent of eternity? Do you not hear it? Do you not smell it? My world has just become perfect, midnight is also noonday, pain is also joy, a curse is also a blessing, the night is also a sun – be gone, or you will learn: a wise man is also a fool.  Did you ever say Yes to one joy? O my friends, then you said Yes to all woe as well.  All things are chained and entwined together, all things are in love; if ever you wanted one moment twice, if ever you said: ‘You please me, happiness, instant, moment!’ then you wanted everything to return I you wanted everything anew, everything eternal, everything chained, entwined together, everything in love, O that is how you loved the world, you everlasting men, loved it eternally and for all time: and you say even to woe:’ Go, but return!’ For all joy wants -eternity ! 11 All joy wants the eternity of all things, wants honey, wants dregs, wants intoxicated midnight, wants graves, wants the consolation of graveside tears, wants gilded sunsets, what does joy not want! it is thirstier, warmer, hungrier, more fearful, more secret than all woe, it wants itself; it bites into itself , the will of the ring wrestles within it, it wants love, it wants hatred, it is superabundant, it gives, throws away, begs for someone to take it, thanks him who takes, it would like to be hated; so rich is joy that it thirsts for woe, for Hell, for hatred, for shame, for the lame, for the world – for it knows, oh it knows this world! You Higher Men, joy longs for you, joy the intractable, blissful – for your woe, you ill-constituted! All eternal joy longs for the ill-constituted.  For all joy wants itself, therefore it also wants heart’s agony I O happiness! O pain! Oh break, heart! You Higher Men, learn this, learn that joy wants eternity, joy wants the eternity of all things, wants deep, deep, deep eternity ! 12 Have you now learned my song? Have you divined what it means? Very well! Come on! You Higher Men, now sing my roundelay! Now sing yourselves the song whose name is ‘Once more’, whose meaning is ‘To all eternity!’ – sing, you Higher Men, Zarathustra’s roundelay! O Man! Attend! What does deep midnight’s voice contend? ‘I slept my sleep, ‘And now awake at dreaming’s end: ‘The world is deep, ‘Deeper than day can comprehend.  ‘Deep is its woe, ‘Joy – deeper than heart’s agony: ‘Woe says: Fade! Go! ‘Bat all joy wants eternity, ‘Wants deep, deep, deep eternity !’ Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Seven Seals (or: The Song of Yes and Amen) 1 I F I be a prophet and full of that prophetic spirit that wanders on high ridges between two seas, wanders between past and future like a heavy cloud, enemy to sultry lowlands and to all that is weary and can neither die nor live: ready for lightning in its dark bosom and for redeeming beams of light, pregnant with lightnings which affirm Yes! laugh Yes! ready for prophetic lightning-flashes: but blessed is he who is thus pregnant! And, in truth, he who wants to kindle the light of the future must hang long over the mountains like a heavy storm! Oh how should I not lust for eternity and for the wedding ring of rings – the Ring of Recurrence! Never yet did I find the woman by whom I wanted children, unless it be this woman, whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity! For I love you, O Eternity! 2 If ever my anger broke graves open, moved boundary-stones, and rolled old shattered law-tables into deep chasms: if ever my mockery blew away mouldered words, and if I came like a broom to the Cross-spiders and as a scouring wind to old sepulchres: if ever I sat rejoicing where old gods lay buried, world-blessing, world-loving, beside the monuments of old world-slanderers: for I love even churches and the graves of gods, if only heaven is looking, pure-eyed, through their shattered roofs; I like to sit like grass and red poppies on shattered churches: Oh how should I not lust for eternity and for the wedding ring of rings – the Ring of Recurrence! Never yet did I find the woman by whom I wanted children, unless it be this woman, whom I love: for I love VCM , O Eternity! For I love you, O Eternity! 3 If ever a breath of the creative breath has come to me, and a breath of that heavenly necessity that compels even chance to dance in star-rounds: if ever I have laughed with the laugh of the creative lightning, which the thunder of the deed, grumbling but obedient, follows: if ever I have played dice with the gods at their table, the earth, so that the earth trembled and broke open and streams of fire snorted forth: for the earth is a table of the gods, and trembling with creative new words and the dice throws of the gods: Oh how should I not lust for eternity and for the wedding ring of rings – the Ring of Recurrence! Never yet did I find the woman by whom I wanted children, unless it be this woman, whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity! For I love you, O Eternity! 4 If ever I have drunk a full draught from that foaming mixing-bowl of spice, in which all things are well compounded: if ever my hand has welded the furthest to the nearest, and fire to spirit and joy to sorrow and the wickedest to the kindest: if I myself am a grain of that redeeming salt that makes everything mix well together in the bowl: for there is a salt that unites good with evil; and even the most evil is worthy to be a spice and a last over-foaming: Oh how should I not lust for eternity and for the wedding ring of rings – the Ring of Recurrence! Never yet did I find the woman by whom I wanted children, unless it be this woman, whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity! For I love you, O Eternity! 5 If I love the sea and all that is sea like, and love it most when it angrily contradicts me: if that delight in seeking that drives sails towards the undiscovered is in me, if a seafarer’s delight is in my delight: if ever my rejoicing has cried:’ The shore has disappeared – now the last fetter falls from me, ‘the boundless roars around me, far out glitter space and time, well then, come on! old heart!’ Oh how should I not lust for eternity and for the wedding ring of rings – the Ring of Recurrence! Never yet did I find the woman by whom I wanted children, unless it be this woman, whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity! For I love you, O Eternity! 6 If my virtue is a dancer’s virtue, and if I often leap with both feet in golden-emerald rapture: if my wickedness is a laughing wickedness, at home among rose bowers and hedges of lilies: for in laughter all evil is present, but sanctified and absolved through its own happiness: and if it be my Alpha and Omega that everything heavy shall become light, every body a dancer, all spirit a bird: and, truly, that is my Alpha and Omega! Oh how should I not lust for eternity and for the wedding ring of rings – the Ring of Recurrence! Never yet did I find the woman by whom I wanted children, unless it be this woman, whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity! For I love you, O Eternity! 7 If ever I spread out a still sky above myself and flew with my own wings into my own sky: if, playing, I have swum into deep light-distances and bird-wisdom came to my freedom: but thus speaks bird-wisdom: ‘Behold, there is no above, no below! Fling yourself about, out, back, weightless bird I Sing! speak no more! ‘are not all words made for the heavy? Do not all words lie to the light? Sing! speak no more!’ Oh how should I not lust for eternity and for the wedding ring of rings – the Ring of Recurrence! Never yet did I find the woman by whom I wanted children, unless it be this woman, whom I love: for I love you, O Eternity! For I love you, O Eternity! Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of the Land of Culture I FLEW too far into the future: a horror assailed me.  And when I looked around, behold! time was my only contemporary.  Then I flew back, homeward – and faster and faster I flew: and so I came to you, you men of the present, and to the land of culture.  The first time I brought with me an eye to see you and healthy desires: truly, I came to you with longing in my heart.  But how did I fare? Although I was so afraid – I had to laugh! My eye had never seen anything so motley-spotted! I laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled and my heart as well: ‘Here must be the home of all the paint-pots!’ I said.  Painted with fifty blotches on face and limbs: thus you sat there to my astonishment, you men of the present! And with fifty mirrors around you, flattering and repeating your opalescence! Truly, you could wear no better masks than your own faces, you men of the present! Who could – recognize you! Written over with the signs of the past and these signs over-daubed with new signs: thus you have hidden yourselves well from all interpreters of signs! And if one tests your virility, one finds only sterility! You seem to be baked from colours and scraps of paper glued together.  All ages and all peoples gaze motley out of your veils; all customs and all beliefs speak motley out of your gestures.  He who tore away from you your veils and wraps and paint and gestures would have just enough left over to frighten the birds.  Truly, I myself am the frightened bird who once saw you naked and without paint; and I flew away when the skeleton made advances to me.  I would rather be a day-labourer in the underworld and among the shades of the bygone! – Even the inhabitants of the underworld are fatter and fuller than you! This, yes this is bitterness to my stomach, that I can endure you neither naked nor clothed, you men of the present! And the unfamiliar things of the future, and whatever frightened stray birds, are truly more familiar and more genial than your ‘reality’.  For thus you speak: ‘We are complete realists, and without belief or superstition’: thus you thump your chests – alas, even without having chests! But how should you be able to believe, you motley-spotted men! – you who are paintings of all that has ever been believed! You are walking refutations of belief itself and the fracture of all thought.  Unworthy of belief : that is what I call you, you realists! All ages babble in confusion in your spirits; and the dreaming and babbling of all ages was more real than is your waking! You are unfruitful: therefore you lack belief.  But he who had to create always had his prophetic dreams and star-auguries -and he believed in belief! You are half-open doors at which grave-diggers wait.  And this is your reality: ‘Everything is worthy of perishing.’ Ah, how you stand there, you unfruitful men, how lean-ribbed! And, indeed, many of you have noticed that.  And they have said:’ Perhaps a god has secretly taken something from me there as I slept? Truly, sufficient to form a little woman for himself! ‘Amazing is the poverty of my ribs!’ That is how many a present-day man has spoken.  Yes, you are laughable to me, you men of the present! And especially when you are amazed at yourselves! And woe to me if I could not laugh at your amazement and had to drink down all that is repulsive in your bowels.  However, I will make light of you, since I have heavy things to carry; and what do I care if beetles and dragonflies sit themselves on my bundle! Truly, it shall not become heavier on that account! And the great weariness shall not come to me from you, you men of the present.  Alas, whither shall I climb now with my longing? I look out from every mountain for fatherlands and motherlands.  But nowhere have I found a home; I am unsettled in every city and I depart from every gate.  The men of the present, to whom my heart once drove me, are strange to me and a mockery; and I have been driven from fatherlands and motherlands.  So now I love only my children’s land , the undiscovered land in the furthest sea: I bid my sails seek it and seek it.  I will make amends to my children for being the child of my fathers: and to all the future – for this present! Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra Of Joys and Passions M Y brother, if you have a virtue and it is your own virtue, you have it in common with no one.  To be sure, you want to call it by a name and caress it; you want to pull its ears and amuse yourself with it.  And behold! Now you have its name in common with the people and have become of the people and the herd with your virtue! You would do better to say: ‘Unutterable and nameless is that which torments and delights my soul and is also the hunger of my belly.’ Let your virtue be too exalted for the familiarity of names: and if you have to speak of it, do not be ashamed to stammer.  Thus say and stammer: ‘This is my good, this I love, just thus do I like it, only thus do I wish the good.  ‘I do not want it as a law of God, I do not want it as a human statute: let it be no sign-post to superearths and paradises.  ‘It is an earthly virtue that I love: there is little prudence in it, and least of all common wisdom.  ‘But this bird has built its nest beneath my roof: therefore I love and cherish it – now it sits there upon its golden eggs.’ Thus should you stammer and praise your virtue.  Once you had passions and called them evil.  But now you have only your virtues: they grew from out your passions.  You laid your highest aim in the heart of these passions: then they became your virtues and joys.  And though you came from the race of the hot-tempered or of the lustful or of the fanatical or of the vindictive: At last all your passions have become virtues and all your devils angels.  Once you had fierce dogs in your cellar: but they changed at last into birds and sweet singers.  From your poison you brewed your balsam; you milked your cow, affliction, now you drink the sweet milk of her udder.  And henceforward nothing evil shall come out of you, except it be the evil that comes from the conflict of your virtues.  My brother, if you are lucky you will have one virtue and no more: thus you will go more easily over the bridge.  To have many virtues is to be distinguished, but it is a hard fate; and many a man has gone into the desert and killed himself because he was tired of being a battle and battleground of virtues.  My brother, are war and battle evil? But this evil is necessary, envy and mistrust and calumny among your virtues is necessary.  Behold how each of your virtues desires the highest place: it wants your entire spirit, that your spirit may be its herald, it wants your entire strength in anger, hate, and love.  Every virtue is jealous of the others, and jealousy is a terrible thing.  Even virtues can be destroyed through jealousy.  He whom the flames of jealousy surround at last turns his poisoned sting against himself, like the scorpion.  Ah my brother, have you never yet seen a virtue turn upon itself and stab itself? Man is something that must be overcome: and for that reason you must love your virtues – for you will perish by them.  Thus spoke Zarathustra.  Thus Spoke Zarathustra CHRONOLOGY 1844 15 October.

Thus Spoke Zarathustra The Stillest Hour W HAT has happened to me, my friends? You behold me troubled, driven forth, unwillingly obedient, ready to go – alas, to go away from you ! Yes, Zarathustra must go into his solitude once again: but this time the bear goes unhappily back into his cave! What has happened to me? Who has ordered this? – alas, my mistress will have it so, so she told me; have I ever told you her name? Yesterday towards evening my stillest hour spoke to me: that is the name of my terrible mistress.  And thus it happened, for I must tell you everything, that your hearts may not harden against me for departing so suddenly! Do you know the terror which assails him who is falling asleep? He is terrified down to his toes, because the ground seems to give way, and the dream begins.  I tell you this in a parable.  Yesterday, at the stillest hour, the ground seemed to give way: my dream began.  The hand moved, the dock of my life held its breath – I had never heard such stillness about me: so that my heart was terrified.  Then, voicelessly, something said to me: ‘ You know, Zarathustra? ’ And I cried out for terror at this whisper, and the blood drained from my face: but I kept silent.  Then again, something said to me voicelessly: ‘You know, Zarathustra, but you do not speak!’ And I answered at last defiantly: ‘Yes, I know, but I will not speak!’ Then again something said to me voicelessly: ‘You will not, Zarathustra? Is this true? Do not hide yourself in your defiance!’ And I wept and trembled like a child and said: ‘Alas, I want to, but how can I? Release me from this alone! It is beyond my strength!’ Then again something said to me voicelessly: ‘Of what consequence are you, Zarathustra? Speak your teaching and break!’ And I answered: ‘Ah, is it my teaching? Who am I ? I await one who is more worthy; I am not worthy even to break by it.’ Then again something said to me voicelessly: ‘Of what consequence are you? You are not yet humble enough.  Humility has the toughest hide.’ And I answered: ‘What has the hide of my humility not already endured? I live at the foot of my heights: how high are my peaks? No one has yet told me.  But I know my valleys well.’ Then again something said to me voicelessly: ‘O Zarathustra, he who has to move mountains moves valleys and low-lands too.’ And I answered: ‘My words have as yet moved no mountains and what I have spoken has not reached men.  Indeed, I went to men, but I have not yet attained them.’ Then again something said to me voicelessly: ‘How do you know that ? The dew falls upon the grass when the night is at its most silent.’ And I answered: ‘They mocked me when I found and walked my own way; and in truth my feet trembled then.  ‘And they spoke thus to me: You have forgotten the way, now you will also forget how to walk!’ Then again something said to me voicelessly: ‘Of what consequence is their mockery? You are one who has unlearned how to obey: now you shall command! ‘Do you know what it is all men most need? Him who commands great things.  ‘To perform great things is difficult: but more difficult is to command great things.  ‘This is the most unpardonable thing about you: You have the power and you will not rule.’ And I answered: ‘I lack the lion’s voice for command.’ Then again something said to me as in a whisper: ‘It is the stillest words which bring the storm.  Thoughts that come on doves’ feet guide the world.  ‘O Zarathustra, you shall go as a shadow of that which must come: thus you will command and commanding lead the way.’ And I answered: ‘I am ashamed.’ Then again something said to me voicelessly: ‘You must yet become a child and without shame.  ‘The pride of youth is still in you, you have become young late: but he who wants to become a child must overcome even his youth.’ And I considered long and trembled.  At last, however, I said what I had said at first: ‘I will not.’ Then a laughing broke out around me.  Alas, how this laughing tore my body and ripped open my heart! And for the last time something said to me: ‘O Zarathustra, your fruits are ripe but you are not ripe for your fruits! ‘So you must go back into solitude: for you shall yet grow mellow.’ And again something laughed, and fled: then it grew still round me as if with a twofold stillness.  I, however, lay on the ground and the sweat poured from my limbs.  Now you have heard everything, and why I must return to my solitude.  I have kept nothing back from you, my friends.  And you have heard, too, who is the most silent of men – and intends to remain so! Ah, my friends! I should have something more to tell you, I should have something more to give you! Why do I not give it? Am I then mean? When Zarathustra had said these words, however, the violence of his grief and the nearness of his departure from his friends overwhelmed him, so that he wept aloud; and no one knew how to comfort him.  But that night he went away alone and forsook his friends.  Cover .  Fear and Trembling Preamble from the Heart An old proverb pertaining to the outward and visible world says: ‘Only one who works gets bread.’ Oddly enough, the saying doesn’t apply in the world to which it most properly belongs, for the outward world is subject to the law of imperfection; there it happens time and again that one who gets bread is one who does not work, that one who sleeps gets it in greater abundance than one who labours.  In the outward world everything belongs to whoever has it, the outward world is subject to the law of indifference and the genie of the ring obeys the one who wears it, whether he be a Noureddin or an Aladdin, and whoever holds the world’s treasures does so however he came by them.  It is otherwise in the world of spirit.  Here there prevails an eternal divine order, here it does not rain on the just and the unjust alike, here the sun does not shine on both good and evil, here only one who works gets bread, and only one who knows anguish finds rest, only one who descends to the underworld saves the loved one, only one who draws the knife gets Isaac.  He who will not work does not get bread, but will be deluded, as the gods deluded Orpheus with an airy figure in place of the beloved, deluded him because he was tender-hearted, not courageous, deluded him because he was a lyre-player, not a man.  Here it is no help to have Abraham as one’s father, or seventeen centuries of noble ancestry; of anyone who will not work here one can say what is written about Israel’s virgins, he gives birth to wind - while the one who works will give birth to his own father.  Conventional wisdom aims presumptuously to introduce into the world of spirit that same law of indifference under which the outside world groans.  It believes it is enough to have knowledge of large truths.  No other work is necessary.  But then it does not get bread, it starves to death while everything is transformed into gold.  And what else does it know? There were many thousands in the Greece of the time, countless others in later generations, who knew all the victories of Miltiades, but there was only one who lost sleep over them.  There were countless generations that knew the story of Abraham by heart, word for word.  How many did it make sleepless? Now the story of Abraham has the remarkable quality that it will always be glorious no matter how impoverished our understanding of it, but only - for it is true here too - if we are willing to ‘labour and be heavy laden’.  But labour they will not, and yet they still want to understand the story.  One speaks in Abraham’s honour, but how? By making it a commonplace: ‘his greatness was that he so loved God that he was willing to offer him the best he had.’ That is very true, but ‘best’ is a vague expression.  In word and thought one can quite safely identify Isaac with the best, and the man who so thinks can very well puff at his pipe as he does so, and the listener can very well leisurely stretch out his legs.  If the rich young man whom Christ met on the road had sold all his possessions and given them to the poor, we would praise him as we praise all great deeds, but we would not understand even him without some labour.  Yet he would not have become an Abraham even had he given away the best he had.  What is left out of the Abraham story is the anguish; for while I am under no obligation to money, to a son the father has the highest and most sacred of obligations.  Yet anguish is a dangerous affair for the squeamish, so people forget it, notwithstanding they want to talk about Abraham.  So they talk and in the course of conversation they interchange the words ‘Isaac’ and ‘best’.  Everything goes excellently.  Should someone in the audience be suffering from insomnia, however, there is likely to be the most appalling, most profound, tragi-comic misunderstanding.  He goes home, he wants to do just like Abraham; for the son is certainly the best thing he has.  Should that speaker hear word of this, he might go to the man, summon all his clerical authority, and shout: ‘Loathsome man, dregs of society, what devil has so possessed you that you wanted to murder your own son?’ And this priest, who had felt no signs of heat or perspiration while preaching about Abraham, would be surprised at the righteous wrath with which he fulminates against that poor man; he would be pleased with himself, for never had he spoken with such pungency and fervour before.  He would say to himself, and his wife: ‘I’m an orator, all I’ve needed was the opportunity; when I spoke about Abraham on Sunday I didn’t feel at all carried away.’ If the same speaker still had some slight excess of wit to spare he would surely lose it were the sinner to reply coolly and with dignity: ‘It was in fact what you yourself preached on Sunday.’ How could a priest get such an idea into his head? And yet he did so, and the mistake was only that he hadn’t known what he was saying.  Why doesn’t some poet take up situations like these instead of the stuff and nonsense that fills comedies and novels? The comic and the tragic converge on each other here in absolute infinity.  The priest’s speech was no doubt laughable enough in itself, but became infinitely more so in its consequence, and yet that was quite natural.  Or suppose the sinner had acceded without protest to the priest’s reprimand; or that zealous cleric had gone happily home, happy in the knowledge that his effectiveness was not confined to the pulpit but was above all evident in the irresistible power of his ministry to souls, inspiring the congregation on Sunday while on Monday, like a cherub with flaming sword, confronting him who by his deed would put that old proverb to shame which says that the world never practises what the priest preaches.  1 Should the sinner, on the other hand, not be convinced, his situation would be tragic enough.  He would no doubt be executed or sent to the madhouse; in short he would have come into an unhappy relation to so-called reality, though in another sense I should think that Abraham made him happy: for he who labours does not perish.  What explains a contradiction like this speaker’s? Is it because Abraham has acquired proprietary rights to the title of great man, so that whatever he does is great, and if anyone else does the same it is a sin, a crying sin? If so, I have no wish to take part in such mindless praise.  If faith cannot make it into a holy deed to murder one’s own son, then let the judgement fall on Abraham as on anyone else.  If one hasn’t the courage to think this thought through, to say that Abraham was a murderer, then surely it is better to acquire that courage than to waste time on undeserved speeches in his praise.  The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he was willing to murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he was willing to sacrifice Isaac; but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make one sleepless; and yet without that anguish Abraham is not the one he is.  Or perhaps Abraham simply didn’t do what the story says, perhaps in the context of his times what he did was something quite different.  Then let’s forget him, for why bother remembering a past that cannot be made into a present? Or perhaps something to do with the ethical aspect slipped that speaker’s mind, the fact that Isaac was the son.  For if you simply remove faith as a nix and nought there remains only the raw fact that Abraham was willing to murder Isaac, which is easy enough for anyone without faith to imitate; without the faith, that is, which makes it hard.  For my own part I don’t lack the courage to think a thought whole.  No thought has frightened me so far.  Should I ever come across one I hope I will at least have the honesty to say: ‘This thought scares me, it stirs up something else in me so that I don’t want to think it.’ If that is wrong of me I’ll no doubt get my punishment.  If I had conceded the truth of the judgement that Abraham was a murderer, I am not sure that I would have been able to silence my reverence of him.  But if that is what I myself thought, then I would presumably keep quiet, for thoughts like that are not to be intimated to others.  However, Abraham is no illusion; he hasn’t slept himself to fame; he does not owe his celebrity to any whim of fate.  Can one speak unreservedly of Abraham, then, without risking that someone will go off the rails and do likewise? Unless I dare to speak quite openly I will simply keep quiet about Abraham, and above all not diminish him so that by that very fact he becomes a snare for the weak.  If one makes faith the main thing - that is, makes it what it is - then I imagine one might dare speak of it without that risk in this day of ours which can hardly be said to outdo itself in faith, and it is only in respect of faith that one achieves resemblance to Abraham, not murder.  If one makes love into a fleeting mood, into a pleasurable agitation in a person, then one lays traps for the weak when talking of the achievements of love.  Of course everyone has momentary feelings, but if those were to be used as reasons for doing the terrible things that love has hallowed as immortal deeds everything would be lost, both the achievement and those misled in this way.  It should be all right, then, to speak about Abraham.  The great can never do harm when grasped in their greatness.  It is like a two-edged sword, bringing death and salvation.  If it should fall to my lot to speak of him, I would begin by showing what a devout and God-fearing man Abraham was, deserving to be called God’s chosen.  Only such a person is subjected to such a trial; but who is such a person? Next I would describe how Abraham loved Isaac.  To that end I would beg the support of all good spirits in making my speech as fervent as is the love of a father for his son.  I would hope to describe it in such a way that not many a father in the realm would dare maintain that he loved his son thus.  Yet if he did not love as Abraham, all thought of offering Isaac would be a temptation.  Here we already have plenty to speak of for several Sundays, so there is no need to rush.  The result, if the speech does justice to the theme, will be that some fathers will simply not want to hear more, but be happy for the time being if they have really succeeded in loving as Abraham did.  Should one of them after having caught the greatness of Abraham’s deed, but also the appallingness of it, venture out on the road, I would saddle my horse and ride along with him.  At every stop before we came to the mountain in Moriah I would explain to him that he could still turn back, could rue the misunderstanding that he was called to be tried in a conflict of this nature, could confess that he lacked the courage, so that if God wanted Isaac God must take him himself.  It is my conviction that such a person will not be disavowed, but can be blessed along with all others, though not in time.  Even in times of faith would such a person not be judged in this way? I knew someone who once could have saved my life had he possessed magnanimity.  He said plainly: ‘I see well enough what I could do, but I don’t dare.  I’m afraid that later I shall lack strength, that I shall regret it.’ He was not magnanimous, but would anyone cease to love him on that account? Having spoken thus, and moved my audience so that they appreciated at least something of the dialectical struggle of faith and its gigantic passion, I would not be guilty of the error they might impute to me by thinking: ‘Well, he has faith in such a high degree it’s enough for us just to hold on to his coat-tails.’ For I would add: ‘By no means have I faith.  I am a shrewd fellow by nature, such as always have great difficulty making the movement of faith, though I wouldn’t attach any importance in itself to a difficulty which, by overcoming it, brings a shrewd fellow no further than the most ordinary and simple-minded person has already reached without the difficulty .’ Love, after all, has its priests in the poets, and occasionally one hears a voice that knows how to keep it in shape; but about faith one hears not a word, who speaks in this passion’s praises? Philosophy goes further.  Theology sits all painted at the window courting philosophy’s favour, offering philosophy its delights.  It is said to be hard to understand Hegel, while understanding Abraham, why, that’s a bagatelle.  To go beyond Hegel, that is a miracle, but to go beyond Abraham is the simplest of all.  I for my part have devoted considerable time to understanding the Hegelian philosophy, believe also that I have more or less understood it, am rash enough to believe that at those points where, despite the trouble taken, I cannot understand it, the reason is that Hegel himself hasn’t been altogether clear.  All this I do easily, naturally, without it causing me any mental strain.  But when I have to think about Abraham I am virtually annihilated.  I am all the time aware of that monstrous paradox that is the content of Abraham’s life.  I am constantly repulsed, and my thought, for all its passion, is unable to enter into it, cannot come one hairbreadth further.  I strain every muscle to catch sight of it, but the same instant I become paralysed.  I am not unacquainted with what has been admired as great and magnanimous in the world; my soul feels an affinity with it, and is in all humility convinced that it was in my cause too that the hero strove; as I contemplate his striving I exclaim to myself: ‘ Jam tua res agitur ’ Now it’s your affair that’s at stake.  The hero I can think myself into, but not Abraham; when I reach that height I fall down since what I’m offered is a paradox.  Yet I by no means think that faith is therefore something inferior, on the contrary that it is the highest, at the same time believing it dishonest of philosophy to offer something else instead and to slight faith.  Philosophy cannot and should not give us an account of faith, but should understand itself and know just what it has indeed to offer, without taking anything away, least of all cheating people out of something by making them think it is nothing.  I am not unacquainted with life’s needs and dangers, I do not fear them, and I go to meet them undaunted.  I am not unfamiliar with horror, my memory is a faithful wife and my imagination, unlike myself, a diligent maid who sits quietly all day at her work and in the evening can speak so prettily for me that I just have to look at it even if it isn’t always landscapes or flowers or pastoral idylls she paints.  I have seen horror face to face, I do not flee it in fear but know very well that, however bravely I face it, my courage is not that of faith and not at all to be compared with it.  I cannot close my eyes and hurl myself trustingly into the absurd, for me it is impossible, but I do not praise myself on that account.  I am convinced that God is love; this thought has for me a pristine lyrical validity.  When it is present to me I am unspeakably happy, when it is absent I yearn for it more intensely than the lover for the beloved; but I do not have faith; this courage I lack.  God’s love is for me, both in a direct and inverse sense, incommensurable with the whole of reality.  I am not coward enough to whimper and moan on that account, but neither am I underhand enough to deny that faith is something far higher.  I can very well carry on living in my manner, I am happy and satisfied, but my happiness is not that of faith and compared with that is indeed unhappy.  I do not burden God with my petty cares, details don’t concern me, I gaze only upon my love and keep its virginal flame pure and clear; faith is convinced that God troubles himself about the smallest thing.  In this life I am content to be wedded to the left hand, faith is humble enough to demand the right; and that it is indeed humility I don’t, and shall never, deny.  But I wonder whether all my contemporaries really are capable of making the movement of faith? Unless I am much mistaken they are more inclined to pride themselves for doing what they don’t even think me capable of, i.e.  the imperfect.  It is against my nature to do what people so often do, talk inhumanly about the great as though some thousands of years were a huge distance; I prefer to talk about it humanly as though it happened yesterday and let only the greatness itself be the distance that either exalts or condemns.  If - in the guise of tragic hero, for higher than that I cannot come - I were summoned to such an extraordinary royal progress as that to the mountain in Moriah I know very well what I would have done.  I would not have been coward enough to stay at home, nor would I have rested on the way or dawdled, or forgotten the knife to create some delay; I am fairly certain I would have been there on the dot, with everything arranged - I might even have come too early instead, so as to have done with it quickly.  But I also know what else I would have done.  The moment I mounted the horse I would have said to myself: ‘Now everything is lost, God demands Isaac, I sacrifice him, and with him all my joy - yet God is love and for me continues to be so.’ For in the temporal world God and I cannot talk together, we have no common language.  Perhaps someone or other in our time would be foolish enough, envious enough of the great, to want to suppose, and have me suppose, that had I actually done this I would have done something even greater than Abraham, for wouldn’t my immense resignation be far more idealistic and poetic than Abraham’s narrow-mindedness? And yet this is the greatest falsehood, for my immense resignation would be a substitute for faith.  Nor could I have made more than the infinite movement in order to find myself again and rest once more in myself.  Neither would I have loved Isaac as Abraham did.  The fact that I made the movement resolutely might demonstrate my courage humanly speaking, that I loved him with all my soul is a precondition without which the whole affair becomes an act of wickedness, and yet I would not have loved as Abraham loved; for then I would have held back at the very last minute, though without this meaning that I’d arrive late at the mountain in Moriah.  Further more my behaviour would have vitiated the whole story, for I would have been at a loss had I got Isaac back again.  What Abraham found the easiest of all would for me be hard, to find joy again in Isaac! For he who with all the infinity of his soul, proprio motu et propriis auspiciis on his own accord and on his own responsibility, has made the infinite movement and can do no more, that person only keeps Isaac with pain.  But what did Abraham do? He came neither too early nor too late.  He mounted the ass, he rode slowly down the path.  All along he had faith, he believed that God would not demand Isaac of him, while still he was willing to offer him if that was indeed what was demanded.  He believed on the strength of the absurd, for there could be no question of human calculation, and it was indeed absurd that God who demanded this of him should in the next instant withdraw the demand.  He climbed the mountain, even in that moment when the knife gleamed he believed - that God would not demand Isaac.  Certainly he was surprised by the outcome, but by means of a double movement he had come back to his original position and therefore received Isaac more joyfully than the first time.  Let us go further.  We let Isaac actually be sacrificed.  Abraham had faith.  His faith was not that he should be happy sometime in the hereafter, but that he should find blessed happiness here in this world.  God could give him a new Isaac, bring the sacrificial offer back to life.  He believed on the strength of the absurd, for all human calculation had long since been suspended.  That sorrow can make one demented may be granted and is hard enough; that there is a strength of will that hauls close enough to the wind to save the understanding, even if the strain turns one slightly odd, that too may be granted.  I don’t mean to decry that.  But to be able to lose one’s understanding and with it the whole of the finite world whose stockbroker it is, and then on the strength of the absurd get exactly the same finitude back again, that leaves me aghast.  But I don’t say on that account that it is of little worth; on the contrary it is the one and only marvel.  It is commonly supposed that what faith produces is no work of art but a crude and vulgar effort only for clumsier natures; yet the truth is quite otherwise.  The dialectic of faith is the most refined and most remarkable of all dialectics, it has an elevation that I can form a conception of but no more.  I can make the great trampoline leap in which I pass over into infinitude, my back is like the tight-rope walker‘s, twisted in my childhood, and so it is easy for me.  One, two, three, I can go upside down in existence, but the next is beyond me, for the marvel I cannot perform but only be amazed at.  Yes, if only Abraham, the instant he swung his leg over the ass’s back, had said to himself: ‘Now Isaac is lost, I could just as well sacrifice him here at home as journey the long road to Moriah’ - then I wouldn’t need Abraham, whereas now I bow to his name seven times and to his deed seventy.  For that is not what he did, as I can prove by the fact that he received Isaac back with joy, really heartfelt joy, that he needed no preparation, no time to adjust himself to finitude and its joy.  Had it not been thus with Abraham he may well have loved God, but he would not have had faith; for he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, while the person who loves God reflects on God.  At this extremity stands Abraham.  The last stage he loses sight of is infinite resignation.  He really does go further and comes to faith, for all these caricatures of faith, the pitiable, lukewarm apathy that thinks ‘There’s surely no need, it’s not worth worrying before the time’, the miserable hope that says ‘Who knows what may happen, it’s possible certainly’ - these distortions belong to life’s wretchedness, and these infinite resignation has already infinitely scorned.  Abraham I cannot understand; in a way all I can learn from him is to be amazed.  If one imagines one can be moved to faith by considering the outcome of this story, one deceives oneself, and is out to cheat God of faith’s first movement, one is out to suck the life-wisdom out of the paradox.  One or another may succeed, for our age does not stop with faith, with its miracle of turning water into wine; it goes further, it turns wine into water.  Would it not be best all the same to stop with faith, and is it not disturbing that everyone wants to go further? When people nowadays-as is in fact variously announced - will not stop with love, where is it they are going? To worldly wisdom, petty calculation, to paltriness and misery, to all that can put man’s divine origin in doubt? Would it not be better to remain standing at faith, and for the one who stands there to take care not to fall? For the movement of faith must be made continually on the strength of the absurd, though in such a way, be it noted, that one does not lose finitude but gains it all of a piece.  I for my part can indeed describe the movements of faith, but I cannot perform them.  When learning how to make swimming movements, one can hang in a belt from the ceiling; one may be said to describe the movements all right but one isn’t swimming; likewise I can describe the movements of faith but when I am thrown into the water, although I may be said to be swimming (for I’m not among the waders), I make other movements, I make the movements of infinity, while faith does the opposite, having performed the movements of infinity it makes those of finitude.  Lucky the one who can make those movements, he performs a marvel, and I shall never tire of admiring him.  Whether it is Abraham or the servant in Abraham’s house, whether a professor of philosophy or a poor serving-maid is for me absolutely immaterial, I look only at the movements.  But those I do indeed look at and let myself be fooled neither by myself nor by anyone else.  The knights of infinite resignation are readily recognizable, their gait is gliding, bold.  But those who wear the jewel of faith can easily disappoint, for their exterior bears a remarkable similarity to what infinite resignation itself as much as faith scorns, namely the bourgeois philistine.  In my own experience I frankly admit to having found no reliable examples, though I would not deny on that ground that possibly every other person is one.  Still, I have tried now in vain for several years to track one down.  People commonly travel the world over to see rivers and mountains, new stars, garish birds, freak fish, grotesque breeds of human; they fall into an animal stupor that gapes at existence and they think they have seen something.  I am not concerned with this.  But if I knew where such a knight of faith lived I would journey to him on foot, for this marvel concerns me absolutely.  I would not let him slip one instant, but watch every minute how he makes the movements; I would consider myself maintained for life and divide my time between looking at him and practising the movements myself, thus devoting all my time to admiring him.  As I said, I haven’t found such a one; still, I can very well imagine him.  Here he is.  The acquaintance is struck, I am introduced.  The moment I first set eyes on him I thrust him away, jump back, clasp my hands together and say half aloud: ‘Good God! Is this the person, is it really him? He looks just like a tax-gatherer.’ Yet it is indeed him.  I come a little closer, watch the least movement in case some small, incongruous optical telegraphic message from the infinite should appear, a glance, expression, gesture, a sadness, a smile betraying the infinite by its incongruity with the finite.  No! I examine him from top to toe, in case there should be some crack through which the infinite peeped out.  No! He is solid through and through.  His stance? Vigorous, it belongs altogether to finitude, no smartly turned-out townsman taking a stroll out to Fresberg on a Sunday afternoon treads the ground with surer foot; he belongs altogether to the world, no petit bourgeois belongs to it more.  One detects nothing of the strangeness and superiority that mark the knight of the infinite.  This man takes pleasure, takes part, in everything, and whenever one catches him occupied with something his engagement has the persistence of the worldly person whose soul is wrapped up in such things.  He minds his affairs.  To see him at them you would think he was some pen-pusher who had lost his soul to Italian book-keeping, so attentive to detail is he.  He takes a holiday on Sundays.  He goes to church.  No heavenly glance or any other sign of the incommensurable betrays him; if one didn’t know him it would be impossible to set him apart from the rest of the crowd; for at most his hearty, lusty psalm-singing proves that he has a good set of lungs.  In the afternoon he takes a walk in the woods.  He delights in everything he sees, in the thronging humanity, the new omnibuses, the Sound - to run across him on Strandveien you would think he was a shop-keeper having his fling, such is his way of taking pleasure; for he is not a poet and I have sought in vain to prise out of him the secret of any poetic incommensurability.  Towards evening he goes home, his step tireless as a postman’s.  On the way it occurs to him that his wife will surely have some special little warm dish for his return, for example roast head of lamb with vegetables.  If he were to meet a kindred spirit, he could continue as far as Østerport so as to converse with him about this dish with a passion befitting a restaurateur.  As it happens he hasn’t a penny and yet he firmly believes his wife has that delicacy waiting for him.  If she has, to see him eat it would be a sight for superior people to envy and for plain folk to be inspired by, for his appetite is greater than Esau’s.  If his wife doesn’t have the dish, curiously enough he is exactly the same.  On the road he passes a building-site and meets another man.  They talk together for a moment, he has a building raised in a jiffy, having all that’s needed for that.  The stranger leaves him thinking: ‘That must have been a capitalist,’ while my admirable knight thinks: ‘Yes, if it came to that I could surely manage it.’ He takes his ease at an open window and looks down on the square where he lives, at everything that goes on - a rat slipping under a board over the gutter, the children at play - with a composure befitting a sixteen-year-old girl.  And yet he is no genius; I have tried in vain to spy out in him the incommensurability of the genius.  He smokes his pipe in the evening: to see him you would swear it was the cheesemonger opposite vegetating in the dusk.  Carefree as a devil-may-care good-for-nothing, he hasn’t a worry in the world, and yet he purchases every moment that he lives, ‘redeeming the seasonable time’ at the dearest price; not the least thing does he do except on the strength of the absurd.  And yet, and yet - yes, it could drive me to fury, out of envy if for no other reason - and yet this man has made and is at every moment making the movement of infinity.  He drains in infinite resignation the deep sorrow of existence, he knows the bliss of infinity, he has felt the pain of renouncing everything, whatever is most precious in the world, and yet to him finitude tastes just as good as to one who has never known anything higher, for his remaining in the finite bore no trace of a stunted, anxious training, and still he has this sense of being secure to take pleasure in it, as though it were the most certain thing of all.  And yet, and yet the whole earthly form he presents is a new creation on the strength of the absurd.  He resigned everything infinitely, and then took everything back on the strength of the absurd.  He is continually making the movement of infinity, but he makes it with such accuracy and poise that he is continually getting finitude out of it, and not for a second would one suspect anything else.  It is said that the dancer’s hardest task is to leap straight into a definite position, so that not for a second does he have to catch at the position but stands there in it in the leap itself.  Perhaps no dancer can do it - but that knight does it.  The mass of humans live disheartened lives of earthly sorrow and joy, these are the sitters-out who will not join in the dance.  The knights of infinity are dancers too and they have elevation.  They make the upward movement and fall down again, and this too is no unhappy pastime, nor ungracious to behold.  But when they come down they cannot assume the position straightaway, they waver an instant and the wavering shows they are nevertheless strangers in the world.  This may be more or less evident, depending on their skill, but even the most skilled of these knights cannot hide the vacillation.  One doesn’t need to see them in the air, one only has to see them the moment they come and have come to earth to recognize them.  But to be able to land in just that way, and in the same second to look as though one was up and walking, to transform the leap in life to a gait, to express the sublime in the pedestrian absolutely - that is something only the knight of faith can do - and it is the one and only marvel.  Yet this marvel can so easily deceive.  I will therefore describe the movements in a particular case which can illustrate the respective relationships to reality, for it is these that everything turns on.  A young lad falls in love with a princess, the content of his whole life lies in this love, and yet the relationship is one that cannot possibly be brought to fruition, be translated from ideality into reality.  2 The slaves of misery, the frogs in life’s swamp, naturally exclaim: ‘Such love is foolishness; the rich brewer’s widow is just as good and sound a match.’ Let them croak away undisturbed in the swamp.  This is not the manner of the knight of infinite resignation, he does not renounce the love, not for all the glory in the world.  He is no trifler.  He first makes sure that this really is the content of his life, and his soul is too healthy and proud to squander the least thing on getting drunk.  He is not cowardly, he is not afraid to let his love steal in upon his most secret, most hidden thoughts, to let it twine itself in countless coils around every ligament of his consciousness - if the love becomes unhappy he will never be able to wrench himself out of it.  He feels a blissful rapture when he lets it tingle through every nerve, and yet his soul is as solemn as his who has emptied the cup of poison and feels the juice penetrate to every drop of blood - for this moment is life and death.  Having thus imbibed all the love and absorbed himself in it, he does not lack the courage to attempt and risk everything.  He reflects over his life’s circumstances, he summons the swift thoughts that like trained doves obey his every signal, he waves his rod over them, and they rush off in all directions.  But now when they all return as messengers of sorrow and explain to him that it is an impossibility, he becomes quiet, he dismisses them, he remains alone, and he performs the movement.  If what I say here has any meaning the movement must take place properly.  3 For the knight will then, in the first place, have the strength to concentrate the whole of his life’s content and the meaning of reality in a single wish.  If a person lacks this concentration, this focus, his soul is disintegrated from the start, and then he will never come to make the movement, he will act prudently in life like those capitalists who invest their capital in every kind of security so as to gain on the one what they lose on the other - in short, he is not a knight.  Secondly, the knight will have the strength to concentrate the whole of the result of his reflection into one act of consciousness.  If he lacks this focus his soul is disintegrated from the start and he will then never have time to make the movement, he will be forever running errands in life, never enter the eternal; for at the very moment he is almost there he will suddenly discover that he has forgotten something and so must go back.  The next moment he will think it possible, and that is also quite correct; but through such considerations one never comes to make the movement; rather with their help one sinks ever deeper into the mire.  So the knight makes the movement, but what movement? Does he want to forget the whole thing? Because in that too there is a kind of concentration.  No! for the knight does not contradict himself, and it is a contradiction to forget the whole of one’s life’s content and still be the same.  He has no inclination to become another, seeing nothing at all great in that prospect.  Only lower natures forget themselves and become something new.  Thus the butterfly has altogether forgotten that it was a caterpillar, perhaps it can so completely forget in turn that it was a butterfly that it can become a fish.  Deeper natures never forget themselves and never become something other than they were.  So the knight will remember everything; but the memory is precisely the pain, and yet in his infinite resignation he is reconciled with existence.  His love for the princess would take on for him the expression of an eternal love, would acquire a religious character, be transfigured into a love for the eternal being which, although it denied fulfilment, still reconciled him once more in the eternal consciousness of his love’s validity in an eternal form that no reality can take from him.  Fools and young people talk about everything being possible for a human being.  But that is a great mistake.  Everything is possible spiritually speaking, but in the finite world there is much that is not possible.  This impossibility the knight nevertheless makes possible by his expressing it spiritually, but he expresses it spiritually by renouncing it.  The desire which would convey him out into reality, but came to grief on an impossibility, now bends inwards but is not lost thereby nor forgotten.  At times it is the unconscious workings of the desire in him which awaken the memory, at others it is he himself that awakens it, for he is too proud to want to let the whole content of his life seem to have been but a fleeting affair of the moment.  He keeps this love young, and it grows with him in years and beauty.  On the other hand, he needs no finite occasion for its growth.  From the moment he made the movement the princess is lost.  He needs none of this erotic titillation of the nerves at the sight of the loved one, etc., nor does he need in a finite sense to be continually making his farewell, for his memory of her is an eternal one, and he knows very well that those lovers who are so eager to see one another one more time to say farewell are right to be eager, right to think it will be the last time; for as soon as may be they will have forgotten one another.  He has grasped the deep secret that even in loving another one should be sufficient unto oneself.  He pays no further finite attention to what the princess does, and just this proves that he has made the movement infinitely.  Here we have the opportunity to see whether the movement in the individual is proper or not.  There was a person who also believed he had made the movement, but time went by, the princess did something else, she married, say, a prince, and his soul lost the resilience of resignation.  He knew then that he had not made the movement correctly; for one who has infinitely resigned is enough unto himself.  The knight does not cancel his resignation, he keeps it, just as young as in the first instance, he never lets it go, simply because he has made the movement infinitely.  What the princess does cannot disturb him, it is only lower natures who have the law for their actions in someone else, the premisses for their actions outside themselves.  If, on the other hand, the princess is similarly disposed there will be a beautiful development.  She will then introduce herself into that order of knighthood whose members are not admitted by ballot but which anyone can join who has the courage to admit him- or herself, that order of knighthood which proves its immortality by making no distinction between man and woman.  She too will keep her love young and sound, she too will have overcome her agony, even though she does not, as the song says, ‘lie by her lord’s side’.  These two will then be suited to each other in all eternity, with such a strict-tempoed harmonia praestabilita pre-established harmony that were some moment to come, a moment with which they were nevertheless not concerned finitely, for in the finite world they would grow old - were such a moment to come which allowed their love its expression in time, then they would be in a position to begin precisely where they would have begun had they been united from the beginning.  The one, whether man or woman, who understands this can never be deceived, for it is only lower natures who imagine they are deceived.  No girl who lacks this pride really knows what it is to love, but if she is so proud, then all the world’s stratagems and ingenuity cannot deceive her.  In infinite resignation there is peace and repose; anyone who wants it, who has not debased himself by - what is still worse than being too proud - belittling himself, can discipline himself into making this movement, which in its pain reconciles one to existence.  Infinite resignation is that shirt in the old fable.  The thread is spun with tears, bleached by tears, the shirt sewn in tears, but then it also gives better protection than iron and steel.  A defect of the fable is that a third party is able to make the material.  The secret in life is that everyone must sew it for himself; and the remarkable thing is that a man can sew it just as well as a woman.  In infinite resignation there is peace and repose and consolation in the pain, that is if the movement is made properly.  I could easily fill a whole book with the various misunderstandings, awkward positions, and slovenly movements I have encountered in just my own slight experience.  People believe very little in spirit, yet it is precisely spirit that is needed to make this movement; what matters is its not being a one-sided result of dira necessitas; the more it is that the more doubtful it always is that the movement is proper.  To insist that a frigid, sterile necessity is necessarily present is to say that no one may experience death before actually dying, which strikes me as crass materialism.  Yet in our time people are less concerned with making pure movements.  Suppose someone wanting to learn to dance said: ‘For hundreds of years now one generation after another has been learning dance steps, it’s high time I took advantage of this and began straight off with a set of quadrilles.’ One would surely laugh a little at him; but in the world of spirit such an attitude is considered utterly plausible.  What then is education? I had thought it was the curriculum the individual ran through in order to catch up with himself; and anyone who does not want to go through this curriculum will be little helped by being born into the most enlightened age.  Infinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith; for only in infinite resignation does my eternal validity become transparent to me, and only then can there be talk of grasping existence on the strength of faith.  Let us now have the knight of faith make his appearance in the case discussed.  He does exactly the same as the other knight, he infinitely renounces the claim to the love which is the content of his life; he is reconciled in pain; but then comes the marvel, he makes one more movement, more wonderful than anything else, for he says: ‘I nevertheless believe that I shall get her, namely on the strength of the absurd, on the strength of the fact that for God all things are possible.’ The absurd is not one distinction among others embraced by understanding.  It is not the same as the improbable, the unexpected, the unforeseen.  The moment the knight resigned he was convinced of the impossibility, humanly speaking; that was a conclusion of the understanding, and he had energy enough to think it.  In an infinite sense, however, it was possible, through renouncing it as a finite possibility; but then accepting that possibility is at the same time to have given it up, yet for the understanding there is no absurdity in possessing it, for it is only in the finite world that understanding rules and there it was and remains an impossibility.  On this the knight of faith is just as clear; all that can save him is the absurd; and this he grasps by faith.  Accordingly he admits the impossibility and at the same time believes the absurd; for were he to suppose that he had faith without recognizing the impossibility with all the passion of his soul and with all his heart, he would be deceiving himself, and his testimony would carry weight nowhere, since he would not even have come as far as infinite resignation.  Faith is therefore no aesthetic emotion, but something far higher, exactly because it presupposes resignation; it is not the immediate inclination of the heart but the paradox of existence.  Thus that a young girl in the face of all difficulties rests assured that her desire will be fulfilled in no way means that her certainty is that of faith, even if she has been brought up by Christian parents and perhaps gone for a whole year to the pastor.  She is convinced in all her childlike simplicity and innocence.  This assurance too ennobles her nature and gives her a preternatural dimension, so that like a worker of wonders she can charm the finite powers of existence and make even stones weep, while on the other hand in her distraction she can just as well run to Herod as to Pilate and move the whole world with her pleas.  Her conviction is ever so lovable, and one can learn much from her, but one thing one does not learn from her, how to make movements.  Her certainty does not dare look the impossibility in the eye in the pain of resignation.  I can see then that it requires strength and energy and freedom of spirit to make the infinite movement of resignation; I can also see that it can be done.  The next step dumbfounds me, my brain reels; for having made the movement of resignation, now on the strength of the absurd to get everything, to get one’s desire, whole, in full, that requires more-than-human powers, it is a marvel.  But at least I can see this, that the young girl’s conviction is mere frivolity compared with a faith that is unshakeable even when it sees the impossibility.  Whenever I want to make this movement I turn giddy, at the same moment I admire it absolutely and yet in that same instant an immense anxiety seizes my soul, for what is it to test God? And yet this is the movement of faith and remains that, however much philosophy, in order to confuse concepts, will have us suppose that it has faith, however much theology wants to sell it at a bargain price.  Resignation does not require faith, for what I win in resignation is my eternal consciousness, and that is a purely philosophical movement, which I venture upon when necessary, and which I can discipline myself into doing, for every time something finite out-distances me I starve myself until I make the movement; for my eternal consciousness is my love of God, and for me that is higher than anything.  Resignation does not require faith, but it requires faith to get the slightest more than my eternal consciousness, for that more is the paradox.  The movements are often confused.  It is said that faith is needed in order to renounce everything; yes, even more strangely one hears people complain that they have lost faith and on consulting the scale to see where they are, we find curiously enough that they have come no further than the point where they should be making the infinite movement of resignation.  Through resignation I renounce everything, this movement is one I do by myself, and when I do not do it that is because I am cowardly and weak and lack the enthusiasm and have no sense of the importance of the high dignity afforded to every human being, to be his own censor, a dignity greater by far than to be Censor General for the whole Roman Republic.  This movement is one that I make by myself, so what I win is myself in my eternal consciousness, in a blessed compliance with my love for the eternal being.  Through faith I don’t renounce anything, on the contrary in faith I receive everything, exactly in the way it is said what one whose faith is like a mustard seed can move mountains.  It takes a purely human courage to renounce the whole of temporality in order to win eternity, but I do indeed win it and cannot in all eternity renounce that, for that would be a self-contradiction; but it takes a paradoxical and humble courage then to grasp the whole of temporality on the strength of the absurd, and that courage is the courage of faith.  Through faith Abraham did not renounce his claim on Isaac, through his faith he received Isaac.  That rich young man, by virtue of his resignation, should have given everything away, but once he had done so the knight of faith would have to say to him: ‘On the strength of the absurd you shall get every penny back, believe that!’ And these words should by no means be a matter of indifference to the once rich young man; for if he gave his possessions away because he was bored with them, then his resignation was in a sorry state.  Temporality, finitude is what it all turns on.  I am able by my own strength to renounce everything, and then find peace and repose in the pain; I can put up with everything even if that demon, more horrifying than the skull and bones that put terror into men’s hearts - even if madness itself were to hold up the fool’s costume before my eyes and I could tell from its look that it was I who was to put it on; I can still save my soul so long as it is more important for me that my love of God should triumph in me than my worldly happiness.  A man can still, in that last moment, concentrate his whole soul in a single glance towards the heaven from which all good gifts come, and this glance is something both he and the one he seeks understand; it means he has nevertheless remained true to his love.  Then he will calmly put on the costume.  He who lacks this romanticism has sold his soul, whether he received a kingdom for it or a paltry piece of silver.  But by my own strength I cannot get the least little thing of what belongs to finitude; for I am continually using my energy to renounce everything.  By my own strength I can give up the princess, and I shall be no sulker but find joy and peace and repose in my pain, but with my own strength I cannot get her back again, for all that strength is precisely what I use to renounce my claim on her.  But by faith, says that marvellous knight, by faith you will get her on the strength of the absurd.  Alas, this movement is one I cannot make! As soon as I want to begin it everything turns around and I flee back to the pain of resignation.  I can swim in life, but for this mysterious floating I am too heavy.  To exist in such a way that my opposition to existence expresses itself every instant as the most beautiful and safest harmony, that I cannot.  And yet it must be glorious to get the princess, I say so every instant and the knight of resignation who doesn’t say it is a deceiver, he has not had just one desire and he has not kept his desire young in its pain.  Some might find it convenient enough that the desire is no longer alive, that the smart of pain has dulled; but such people are no knights.  A free-born soul who caught himself at this would despise himself and make a fresh start, and above all not allow himself to be deceived in his soul.  And yet it must be wonderful to get the princess, and yet it is only the knight of faith who is happy, only he is heir apparent to the finite, whereas the knight of resignation is a stranger, a foreigner.  To get the princess in this way, to live in joy and happiness, in her company day in and day out - we have to allow, of course, that the knight of resignation, too, may get the princess, even though he has clearly perceived the impossibility of their future happiness - thus to live joyfully and happily in this way every moment on the strength of the absurd, every moment to see the sword hanging over the loved one’s head and yet find, not repose in the pain of resignation, but joy on the strength of the absurd - that is wonderful.  The one who does that, he is great, the only great one, the thought of it stirs my soul, which was never sparing in its admiration of greatness.  Now if everyone in my generation unwilling to stop at faith is really someone who has understood life’s horror, has grasped Daub’s meaning when he says that a soldier standing guard alone with a loaded gun by a powder magazine on a stormy night gets strange thoughts; if all those unwilling to stop at faith really are people who possess the strength of soul to grasp, and give themselves time to be alone with, the thought that what they wished was impossible; if all who are unwilling to stop at faith have really reconciled themselves in pain and been reconciled by pain; if all those unwilling to stop at faith have in addition (and unless they have done all this other they need not trouble themselves in matters of faith) performed that marvel, grasped the whole of existence on the strength of the absurd - then what I am writing is a speech in the highest praise of my generation by the least in it, by the one who could only make the movement of resignation.  But why will they not stop at faith, why do we sometimes hear of people blushing to admit they have faith? That I cannot grasp.  Should I ever come so far as to manage this movement, I’d drive thereafter with a coach-and-four.  Is it really the case, can all the bourgeois philistinism I see in life, and which I allow only my deeds and not my words to condemn, really be not what it seems? Is it really this marvel? That is certainly conceivable, for our hero of faith did indeed bear a striking resemblance to it, for our hero of faith was not even an ironist and humorist but something still higher.  A lot is said in our time about irony and humour, particularly by people who have never succeeded in practising them but who nevertheless know how to explain everything.  I am not altogether unfamiliar with these two passions, I know a little more about them than is to be found in German and German Danish compendia.  Therefore I know that these two passions differ essentially from the passion of faith.  Irony and humour reflect also upon themselves and so belong in the sphere of infinite resignation, they owe their resilience to the individual’s incommensurability with reality.  The last movement, the paradoxical movement of faith I cannot perform, be it a duty or whatever - though in fact I would be most willing to do it.  Whether anyone has the right to say this must be up to him; it is a matter between him and the eternal being who is the object of faith whether he can reach an amicable agreement in this respect.  What everyone can do, on the other hand, is perform the infinite movement of resignation, and I for my part would not think twice about pronouncing anyone a coward who thinks he can’t.  With faith it is another matter.  But what no one has the right to do is let others suppose that faith is something inferior or that it is an easy matter, when in fact it is the greatest and most difficult of all.  Some understand the story of Abraham in another way.  They praise God’s mercy for giving him Isaac once again, the whole thing was just a trial.  A trial - that can say a lot or little, yet the whole thing is as quickly done with as said.  One mounts a winged horse, that very instant one is on the mountain in Moriah, the same instant one sees the ram.  One forgets that Abraham rode on an ass, which can keep up no more than a leisurely pace, that he had a three-day journey, that he needed time to chop the firewood, bind Isaac, and sharpen the knife.  And yet one praises Abraham! The speaker might just as well sleep until fifteen minutes before speaking, his hearer might just as well sleep throughout the speech, since it all goes so smoothly, without trouble from either side.  Should someone present be suffering from insomnia, that person might go home, sit down in a corner, and think: ‘It’s all over in a second, if you’ll just wait a minute you’ll see the ram and the trial is over.’ Were the speaker to meet him in that state then I imagine he would advance on him in all his dignity and say: ‘Wretch, that you can let your soul sink into such folly; there is no miracle, and all life is a trial.’ The more effusive the speaker became the more heated he would grow and the better pleased with himself, and while he had noticed no congestion of the blood when speaking about Abraham, he could now feel the vein swelling on his forehead.  He might perhaps be struck dumb were the sinner, calmly and with dignity, to reply: ‘But that’s what you preached last Sunday.’ So let us either forget all about Abraham or learn how to be horrified at the monstrous paradox which is the significance of his life, so that we can understand that our time like any other can be glad if it has faith.  If Abraham is not a nonentity, a ghost, a piece of pomp one uses to pass time away, the mistake can never lie in the sinner’s wanting to do like him; rather it is a question of seeing the greatness of Abraham’s deed, so that the person may judge for himself whether he has the inclination and courage to be tried in such a thing.  The comic contradiction in the speaker’s behaviour was that he made Abraham into something insignificant and yet would forbid the other from carrying on in the same manner.  Should one perhaps not dare to speak about Abraham? I think one should.  If I myself were to talk about him I would first depict the pain of the trial.  For that I would suck all the fear, distress, and torment out of the father’s suffering, like a leech, in order to be able to describe all that Abraham suffered while still believing.  I would remind people that the journey lasted three days and well into the fourth; yes, those three-and-a-half days should be infinitely longer than the two thousand years separating me from Abraham.  Then I would remind them that everyone, as I believe, should feel able to change their mind before beginning on such a thing, that it is possible at every moment to retract and turn back.  If one does this I see no danger; nor am I afraid of arousing a desire in people to be put to the test like Abraham.  But if one wants to market a cut-price version of Abraham and then still admonish people not to do what Abraham did, then that’s just laughable.  What I intend now is to extract from the story of Abraham its dialectical element, in the form of problemata, in order to see how monstrous a paradox faith is, a paradox capable of making a murder into a holy act well pleasing to God, a paradox which gives Isaac back to Abraham, which no thought can grasp because faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off.

If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation rose up after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation succeeded the other as the songs of birds in the woods, if the human race passed through the world as a ship through the sea or the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lurked hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches - how empty and devoid of comfort would life be! But for that reason it is not so, and as God created man and woman, so too he shaped the hero and the poet or speech-maker.  The latter has none of the skills of the former, he can only admire, love, take pleasure in the hero.  Yet he, too, no less than the hero, is happy; for the hero is so to speak that better nature of his in which he is enamoured, though happy that it is not himself, that his love can indeed be admiration.  He is the spirit of remembrance, can only bring to mind what has been done, do nothing but admire what has been done.  He takes nothing of himself, but is jealous of his charge.  He follows his heart’s desire, but having found what he sought he wanders round to everyone’s door with his song and his speech, so that all can admire the hero as he does, be proud of the hero as he is.  That is his achievement, his humble task, this his faithful service in the hero’s house.  If he remains thus true to his love, if he struggles night and day against the wiles of oblivion, which would cheat him of his hero, then he has fulfilled his task, he is united with the hero who in his turn has loved him just as faithfully, for the poet is so to speak the hero’s better nature, ineffectual certainly as a memory is, but also transfigured as a memory is.  Therefore no one who was great will be forgotten: and however long it takes, even if a cloud of misunderstanding should take the hero away, his lover still comes, and the more time goes by the more faithfully he sticks by him.  No! No one shall be forgotten who was great in this world; but everyone was great in his own way, and everyone in proportion to the greatness of what he loved.  For he who loved himself became great in himself, and he who loved others became great through his devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all.  They shall all be remembered, but everyone became great in proportion to his expectancy.  One became great through expecting the possible, another by expecting the eternal; but he who expected the impossible became greater than all.  They shall all be remembered, but everyone was great in proportion to the magnitude of what he strove with.  For he who strove with the world became great by conquering the world, and he who strove with himself became greater by conquering himself; but he who strove with God became greater than all.  Thus there was strife in the world, man against man, one against thousands, but he who strove with God was greater than all.  Thus there was strife upon earth: there was he who conquered everything by his own strength, and he who conquered God by his powerlessness.  There was one who relied upon himself and gained everything, and one who, secure in his own strength, sacrificed everything; but greater than all was the one who believed God.  There was one who was great in his strength, and one who was great in his wisdom, and one who was great in hope, and one who was great in love; but greater than all was Abraham, great with that power whose strength is powerlessness, great in that wisdom whose secret is folly, great in that hope whose outward form is insanity, great in that love which is hatred of self.  It was by his faith that Abraham could leave the land of his fathers to become a stranger in the land of promise.  He left one thing behind, took another with him.  He left behind his worldly understanding and took with him his faith.  Otherwise he would surely not have gone; certainly it would have been senseless to do so.  It was by his faith that he could be a stranger in the promised land; there was nothing to remind him of what was dear, but the novelty of everything tempted his soul to sad longing.  And yet he was God’s chosen, in whom the Lord was well pleased! Yes, indeed! If only he had been disowned, cast out from God’s grace, he would have understood it better.  As it was it looked more like a mockery of himself and his faith.  There was once another who lived in exile from the beloved land of his fathers.  He is not forgotten, nor his songs of lament in which in sorrow he sought and found what he had lost.  From Abraham we have no song of lament.  It is human to complain, human to weep with one who weeps, but it is greater to have faith and more blessed to behold the believer.  It was faith that made Abraham accept the promise that all nations of the earth should be blessed in his seed.  Time went by, the possibility was still there, and Abraham had faith; time went by, it became unlikely, and Abraham had faith.  There was once another who held out an expectation.  Time went by, the evening drew near, he was not so pitiful as to forget his expectation; therefore he too should not be forgotten.  Then he sorrowed, and the sorrow did not deceive him as life had done; it did all it could for him and in the sweetness of sorrow he possessed his disappointed expectation.  It is human to sorrow with the sorrower, but greater to have faith and more blessed to behold the believer.  From Abraham we have no song of sorrow.  As time went by he did not mournfully count the days, he did not cast suspicious glances at Sarah, fearing she was growing old; he did not stay the march of the sun, so that Sarah should not grow old and with her his expectation; he did not soothingly sing to Sarah his mournful lay.  Abraham became old and Sarah was mocked in the land, and still he was God’s chosen and heir to the promise that in his seed all nations of the earth would be blessed.  Would it not be better, then, were he not God’s chosen? What is it to be God’s chosen? Is it to be denied in youth one’s youthful desire in order to have it fulfilled in great travail in old age? But Abraham believed and held firm to the promise.  Had Abraham wavered he would have renounced it.  He would have said to God: ‘So perhaps after all it is not your will that it should happen; then I will give up my desire, it was my only desire, my blessed joy.  My soul is upright, I bear no secret grudge because you refused it.’ He would not have been forgotten, he would have saved many by his example, yet he would not have become the father of faith; for it is great to give up one’s desire, but greater to stick to it after having given it up; it is great to grasp hold of the eternal but greater to stick to the temporal after having given it up.  But then came the fullness of time.  Had Abraham not had faith, then Sarah would surely have died of sorrow, and Abraham, dull with grief, instead of understanding the fulfilment, would have smiled at it as at a youthful dream.  But Abraham believed, and therefore he was young; for he who always hopes for the best becomes old, deceived by life, and he who is always prepared for the worst becomes old prematurely; but he who has faith, retains eternal youth.  All praise then to that tale! For Sarah, though stricken in years, was young enough to covet the pleasure of motherhood; and Abraham, though grey of head, was young enough to want to be a father.  Outwardly the wonder of faith is in Abraham and Sarah’s being young enough for it to happen according to their expectations; in a deeper sense the wonder of faith lies in Abraham and Sarah’s being young enough to wish, and in faith’s having preserved their wish and through it their youthfulness.  He accepted the fulfilment of the promise, he accepted it in faith, and it happened according to expectation and according to faith; for Moses struck the rock with his rod but he did not believe.  So there was rejoicing in Abraham’s house when Sarah was bride on their golden-wedding day.  But it was not to remain so; Abraham was to be tried once more.  He had fought with that subtle power that invents everything, with that watchful opponent that never takes a nap, with that old man who outlives everything - time itself.  He had fought with it and kept his faith.  Now all the horrors of the struggle were to be concentrated in one moment.  ‘And God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him ...  Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.’ So all was lost, more terrible than if it had never been! So the Lord was only making sport of Abraham! Through a miracle he had made the preposterous come true, now he would see it again brought to nothing.  Foolery indeed! But Abraham did not laugh at it, as Sarah had laughed when the promise had first been proclaimed.  All was lost! Seventy years’ faithful expectation, the brief joy at faith’s fulfilment.  Who is it then that snatches the staff from the old man, who is it that demands that the old man himself should break it? Who is it that makes a man’s grey hairs forlorn, who is it that demands that he himself should make them so? Is there no compassion for this venerable greybeard, none for the innocent child? And yet Abraham was God’s chosen, and it was the Lord who put him to this test.  All was now surely lost! The glorious memory of the human race, the promise in Abraham’s seed, it was only a whim, a fleeting thought of the Lord‘s, which Abraham himself must now eradicate.  That glorious treasure, as old as the faith in Abraham’s heart, many many years older than Isaac, the fruit of Abraham’s life, hallowed with prayers, ripened in struggle - the blessing on Abraham’s lips, this fruit was now to be plucked out of season and have no meaning; for what meaning could there be in it if Isaac was to be sacrificed! That sad yet still blessed hour when Abraham should take leave of everything he held dear, when he should raise his venerable head one time more, when his countenance should be radiant as the Lord’s, when he should concentrate his whole soul in a blessing with the power to give Isaac joy all his days - that moment was not to come! For, yes, Abraham would indeed take leave of Isaac, but it was he that was to remain; death would divide them, but Isaac was to be its victim.  The old man was not to lay his hand upon Isaac in blessing, but weary of life was to lay it upon him in violence.  And it was God who tried him.  Yes.  Woe, woe to the messenger who came before Abraham with such tidings! Who would have dared be the emissary of such sorrow? Yet it was God who tried Abraham.  But Abraham had faith, and had faith for this life.  Yes, had his faith only been for a future life it would indeed have been easier to cast everything aside in order to hasten out of this world to which he did not belong.  But Abraham’s faith was not of that kind, if there is such, for a faith like that is not really faith but only its remotest possibility, a faith that has some inkling of its object at the very edge of the field of vision but remains separated from it by a yawning abyss in which despair plays its pranks.  But it was for this life that Abraham believed, he believed he would become old in his land, honoured among his people, blessed in his kin, eternally remembered in Isaac, the dearest in his life, whom he embraced with a love for which it was but a poor expression to say that he faithfully fulfilled the father’s duty to love the son, as indeed the summons put it: ‘the son whom thou lovest.’ Jacob had twelve sons and he loved one; Abraham had just one, the son he loved.  But Abraham had faith and did not doubt.  He believed the ridiculous.  If Abraham had doubted - then he would have done something else, something great and glorious; for how could Abraham have done other than what is great and glorious? He would have marched out to the mountain in Moriah, chopped the firewood, set light to the fire, drawn the knife - he would have cried out to God: ‘Do not scorn this sacrifice, it is not the best I possess, that I well know; for what is an old man compared with the child of promise, but it is the best I can give.  Let Isaac never come to know, that he may comfort himself in his young years.’ He would have thrust the knife into his own breast.  He would have been admired in the world and his name never forgotten; but it is one thing to be admired, another to be a guiding star that saves the anguished.  But Abraham had faith.  He did not beg for himself in hope of moving the Lord; it was only that time when the just punishment had been proclaimed upon Sodom and Gomorrah that Abraham came forward with his prayers.  We read in those Holy Scriptures: ‘And God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: Abraham, where are you? but Abraham answered: here I am.’ You, to whom my speech is addressed, was that the case with you? When you saw, far off, the heavy fate approaching, did you not say to the mountains, ‘hide me’, to the hills, ‘fall on me’? Or if you were stronger, did your feet nevertheless not drag along the way? Did they not hanker, as it were, to get back into the old tracks? When you were called, did you answer, or did you not? Perhaps softly and in a whisper? Not so Abraham, gladly, boldly, trustingly he answered out loud ‘here I am’.  We read further: ‘And Abraham rose up early in the morning.’ He hurried as though to some celebration, and he was at the appointed place, the mountain in Moriah, early in the morning.  He said nothing to Sarah, nothing to Eleazar.  After all, who could have understood him? Hadn’t the test by its very nature exacted an oath of silence from him? ‘And he clave the wood, he bound Isaac, he kindled the fire, he drew the knife.’ My hearer! Many a father has felt the loss of his child as the loss of the dearest thing he has in the world, to be bereft of every hope for the future; yet no son was the child of promise in the sense that Isaac was for Abraham.  Many a father has lost his child, but then it was God, the unchangeable and inscrutable will of the Almighty, it was his hand that took it.  Not so with Abraham.  For him a harder trial was reserved; along with the knife the fate of Isaac was put into Abraham’s own hand.  And he stood there, the old man with his only hope! But he did not doubt, he did not look in anguish to left or right, he did not challenge heaven with his prayers.  He knew it was God the Almighty that tried him, he knew it was the hardest sacrifice that could be demanded of him; but he also knew that no sacrifice was too hard when God demanded it - and he drew the knife.  Who gave strength to Abraham’s arm, who kept his right arm raised so that it did not fall helplessly down! Anyone who saw this would be paralysed.  Who gave strength to Abraham’s soul, so that his eye did not become too clouded to see either Isaac or the ram! Anyone who saw this would become blind.  And yet rare enough though they may be, those who are both paralysed and blind, still more rare is he who can tell the story and give it its due.  We know it, all of us - it was only a trial.  Had Abraham doubted as he stood on the mountain in Moriah, had he looked about in indecision, if before drawing the knife he had accidentally caught sight of the ram and God had allowed him to offer it in place of Isaac - then he would have gone home, everything would have been as before, he would have had Sarah, he would have kept Isaac, and yet how changed! For his withdrawal would have been a flight, his deliverance an accident, his reward dishonour, his future perhaps damnation.  Then he would have borne witness, not to his faith or to God’s mercy, but to how dreadful was the journey to the mountain in Moriah.  Abraham would not be forgotten, nor the mountain.  Yet it would not be mentioned like Ararat, where the Ark came to land, but as a horror, for it was here that Abraham doubted.  Venerable Father Abraham! When you journeyed home from the mountain in Moriah you needed no speech of praise to console you for what was lost; for in fact you gained everything and kept Isaac.  Was it not so? The Lord never again took him from you, you sat happily at table with him in your tent, as you do in the hereafter in all eternity.  Venerable Father Abraham! Thousands of years have slipped by since those days, but you need no late-coming lover to snatch your memory from the power of oblivion; for every mother-tongue commemorates you - and still you reward your lover more gloriously than anyone.  You make him blessed hereafter in your bosom, you captivate his eye and his heart in the here and now with the marvel of your deed.  Venerable Father Abraham! Second father to the human race! You who first saw and bore witness to that tremendous passion that scorns the fearful struggle with the raging elements and the forces of creation in order to struggle with God instead, you who first knew that supreme passion, the sacred, pure, and humble expression of the divine madness which the pagans admired - forgive him who would speak in your praise if he did not do it correctly.  He spoke humbly, seeing it is his heart’s desire; he spoke briefly, as is fitting; but he will never forget that you needed a hundred years to get the son of your old age, against every expectation, that you had to draw the knife before keeping Isaac; he will never forget that in one hundred and thirty years you got no further than faith.  An Absurd Reasoning, The Myth of Sisyphus AN ABSURD REASONING Absurdity and Suicide T HERE is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.  Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.  All the rest—whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards.  These are games; one must first answer.  And if it is true, as Nietzsche claims, that a philosopher, to deserve our respect, must preach by example, you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it will precede the definitive act.  These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect.  If I ask myself how to judge that this question is more urgent than that, I reply that one judges by the actions it entails.  I have never seen anyone die for the ontological argument.  Galileo, who held a scientific truth of great importance, abjured it with the greatest ease as soon as it endangered his life.  In a certain sense, he did right.  *1 That truth was not worth the stake.  Whether the earth or the sun revolves around the other is a matter of profound indifference.  To tell the truth, it is a futile question.  On the other hand, I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living.  I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying).  I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions.  How to answer it? On all essential problems (I mean thereby those that run the risk of leading to death or those that intensify the passion of living) there are probably but two methods of thought: the method of La Palisse and the method of Don Quixote.  Solely the balance between evidence and lyricism can allow us to achieve simultaneously emotion and lucidity.  In a subject at once so humble and so heavy with emotion, the learned and classical dialectic must yield, one can see, to a more modest attitude of mind deriving at one and the same time from common sense and understanding.  Suicide has never been dealt with except as a social phenomenon.  On the contrary, we are concerned here, at the outset, with the relationship between individual thought and suicide.  An act like this is prepared within the silence of the heart, as is a great work of art.  The man himself is ignorant of it.  One evening he pulls the trigger or jumps.  Of an apartment-building manager who had killed himself I was told that he had lost his daughter five years before, that he had changed greatly since, and that that experience had “undermined” him.  A more exact word cannot be imagined.  Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined.  Society has but little connection with such beginnings.  The worm is in man’s heart.  That is where it must be sought.  One must follow and understand this fatal game that leads from lucidity in the face of existence to flight from light.  There are many causes for a suicide, and generally the most obvious ones were not the most powerful.  Rarely is suicide committed (yet the hypothesis is not excluded) through reflection.  What sets off the crisis is almost always unverifiable.  Newspapers often speak of “personal sorrows” or of “incurable illness.” These explanations are plausible.  But one would have to know whether a friend of the desperate man had not that very day addressed him indifferently.  He is the guilty one.  For that is enough to precipitate all the rancors and all the boredom still in suspension.  *2 But if it is hard to fix the precise instant, the subtle step when the mind opted for death, it is easier to deduce from the act itself the consequences it implies.  In a sense, and as in melodrama, killing yourself amounts to confessing.  It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it.  Let’s not go too far in such analogies, however, but rather return to everyday words.  It is merely confessing that that “is not worth the trouble.” Living, naturally, is never easy.  You continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit.  Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering.  What, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life? A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world.  But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger.  His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land.  This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity.  All healthy men having thought of their own suicide, it can be seen, without further explanation, that there is a direct connection between this feeling and the longing for death.  The subject of this essay is precisely this relationship between the absurd and suicide, the exact degree to which suicide is a solution to the absurd.  The principle can be established that for a man who does not cheat, what he believes to be true must determine his action.  Belief in the absurdity of existence must then dictate his conduct.  It is legitimate to wonder, clearly and without false pathos, whether a conclusion of this importance requires forsaking as rapidly as possible an incomprehensible condition.  I am speaking, of course, of men inclined to be in harmony with themselves.  Stated clearly, this problem may seem both simple and insoluble.  But it is wrongly assumed that simple questions involve answers that are no less simple and that evidence implies evidence.  A priori and reversing the terms of the problem, just as one does or does not kill oneself, it seems that there are but two philosophical solutions, either yes or no.  This would be too easy.  But allowance must be made for those who, without concluding, continue questioning.  Here I am only slightly indulging in irony: this is the majority.  I notice also that those who answer “no” act as if they thought “yes.” As a matter of fact, if I accept the Nietzschean criterion, they think “yes” in one way or another.  On the other hand, it often happens that those who commit suicide were assured of the meaning of life.  These contradictions are constant.  It may even be said that they have never been so keen as on this point where, on the contrary, logic seems so desirable.  It is a commonplace to compare philosophical theories and the behavior of those who profess them.  But it must be said that of the thinkers who refused a meaning to life none except Kirilov who belongs to literature, Peregrinos who is born of legend, *3 and Jules Lequier who belongs to hypothesis, admitted his logic to the point of refusing that life.  Schopenhauer is often cited, as a fit subject for laughter, because he praised suicide while seated at a well-set table.  This is no subject for joking.  That way of not taking the tragic seriously is not so grievous, but it helps to judge a man.  In the face of such contradictions and obscurities must we conclude that there is no relationship between the opinion one has about life and the act one commits to leave it? Let us not exaggerate in this direction.  In a man’s attachment to life there is something stronger than all the ills in the world.  The body’s judgment is as good as the mind’s, and the body shrinks from annihilation.  We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking.  In that race which daily hastens us toward death, the body maintains its irreparable lead.  In short, the essence of that contradiction lies in what I shall call the act of eluding because it is both less and more than diversion in the Pascalian sense.  Eluding is the invariable game.  The typical act of eluding, the fatal evasion that constitutes the third theme of this essay, is hope.  Hope of another life one must “deserve” or trickery of those who live not for life itself but for some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it.  Thus everything contributes to spreading confusion.  Hitherto, and it has not been wasted effort, people have played on words and pretended to believe that refusing to grant a meaning to life necessarily leads to declaring that it is not worth living.  In truth, there is no necessary common measure between these two judgments.  One merely has to refuse to be misled by the confusions, divorces, and inconsistencies previously pointed out.  One must brush everything aside and go straight to the real problem.  One kills oneself because life is not worth living, that is certainly a truth—yet an unfruitful one because it is a truism.  But does that insult to existence, that flat denial in which it is plunged come from the fact that it has no meaning? Does its absurdity require one to escape it through hope or suicide—this is what must be clarified, hunted down, and elucidated while brushing aside all the rest.  Does the Absurd dictate death? This problem must be given priority over others, outside all methods of thought and all exercises of the disinterested mind.  Shades of meaning, contradictions, the psychology that an “objective” mind can always introduce into all problems have no place in this pursuit and this passion.  It calls simply for an unjust—in other words, logical—thought.  That is not easy.  It is always easy to be logical.  It is almost impossible to be logical to the bitter end.  Men who die by their own hand consequently follow to its conclusion their emotional inclination.  Reflection on suicide gives me an opportunity to raise the only problem to interest me: is there a logic to the point of death? I cannot know unless I pursue, without reckless passion, in the sole light of evidence, the reasoning of which I am here suggesting the source.  This is what I call an absurd reasoning.  Many have begun it.  I do not yet know whether or not they kept to it.  When Karl Jaspers, revealing the impossibility of constituting the world as a unity, exclaims: “This limitation leads me to myself, where I can no longer withdraw behind an objective point of view that I am merely representing, where neither I myself nor the existence of others can any longer become an object for me,” he is evoking after many others those waterless deserts where thought reaches its confines.  After many others, yes indeed, but how eager they were to get out of them! At that last crossroad where thought hesitates, many men have arrived and even some of the humblest.  They then abdicated what was most precious to them, their life.  Others, princes of the mind, abdicated likewise, but they initiated the suicide of their thought in its purest revolt.  The real effort is to stay there, rather, in so far as that is possible, and to examine closely the odd vegetation of those distant regions.  Tenacity and acumen are privileged spectators of this inhuman show in which absurdity, hope, and death carry on their dialogue.  The mind can then analyze the figures of that elementary yet subtle dance before illustrating them and reliving them itself.  Absurd Walls Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying.  The regularity of an impulse or a repulsion in a soul is encountered again in habits of doing or thinking, is reproduced in consequences of which the soul itself knows nothing.  Great feelings take with them their own universe, splendid or abject.  They light up with their passion an exclusive world in which they recognize their climate.  There is a universe of jealousy, of ambition, of selfishness, or of generosity.  A universe—in other words, a metaphysic and an attitude of mind.  What is true of already specialized feelings will be even more so of emotions basically as indeterminate, simultaneously as vague and as “definite,” as remote and as “present” as those furnished us by beauty or aroused by absurdity.  At any streetcorner the feeling of absurdity can strike any man in the face.  As it is, in its distressing nudity, in its light without effulgence, it is elusive.  But that very difficulty deserves reflection.  It is probably true that a man remains forever unknown to us and that there is in him something irreducible that escapes us.  But practically I know men and recognize them by their behavior, by the totality of their deeds, by the consequences caused in life by their presence.  Likewise, all those irrational feelings which offer no purchase to analysis.  I can define them practically , appreciate them practically , by gathering together the sum of their consequences in the domain of the intelligence, by seizing and noting all their aspects, by outlining their universe.  It is certain that apparently, though I have seen the same actor a hundred times, I shall not for that reason know him any better personally.  Yet if I add up the heroes he has personified and if I say that I know him a little better at the hundredth character counted off, this will be felt to contain an element of truth.  For this apparent paradox is also an apologue.  There is a moral to it.  It teaches that a man defines himself by his make-believe as well as by his sincere impulses.  There is thus a lower key of feelings, inaccessible in the heart but partially disclosed by the acts they imply and the attitudes of mind they assume.  It is clear that in this way I am defining a method.  But it is also evident that that method is one of analysis and not of knowledge.  For methods imply metaphysics; unconsciously they disclose conclusions that they often claim not to know yet.  Similarly, the last pages of a book are already contained in the first pages.  Such a link is inevitable.  The method defined here acknowledges the feeling that all true knowledge is impossible.  Solely appearances can be enumerated and the climate make itself felt.  Perhaps we shall be able to overtake that elusive feeling of absurdity in the different but closely related worlds of intelligence, of the art of living, or of art itself.  The climate of absurdity is in the beginning.  The end is the absurd universe and that attitude of mind which lights the world with its true colors to bring out the privileged and implacable visage which that attitude has discerned in it.  * * * All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning.  Great works are often born on a streetcorner or in a restaurant’s revolving door.  So it is with absurdity.  The absurd world more than others derives its nobility from that abject birth.  In certain situations, replying “nothing” when asked what one is thinking about may be pretense in a man.  Those who are loved are well aware of this.  But if that reply is sincere, if it symbolizes that odd state of soul in which the void becomes eloquent, in which the chain of daily gestures is broken, in which the heart vainly seeks the link that will connect it again, then it is as it were the first sign of absurdity.  It happens that the stage sets collapse.  Rising, streetcar, four hours in the office or the factory, meal, streetcar, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday according to the same rhythm—this path is easily followed most of the time.  But one day the “why” arises and everything begins in that weariness tinged with amazement.  “Begins”—this is important.  Weariness comes at the end of the acts of a mechanical life, but at the same time it inaugurates the impulse of consciousness.  It awakens consciousness and provokes what follows.  What follows is the gradual return into the chain or it is the definitive awakening.  At the end of the awakening comes, in time, the consequence: suicide or recovery.  In itself weariness has something sickening about it.  Here, I must conclude that it is good.  For everything begins with consciousness and nothing is worth anything except through it.  There is nothing original about these remarks.  But they are obvious; that is enough for a while, during a sketchy reconnaissance in the origins of the absurd.  Mere “anxiety,” as Heidegger says, is at the source of everything.  Likewise and during every day of an unillustrious life, time carries us.  But a moment always comes when we have to carry it.  We live on the future: “tomorrow,” “later on,” “when you have made your way,” “you will understand when you are old enough.” Such irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it’s a matter of dying.  Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty.  Thus he asserts his youth.  But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time.  He takes his place in it.  He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end.  He belongs to time, and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy.  Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it.  That revolt of the flesh is the absurd.  *4 A step lower and strangeness creeps in: perceiving that the world is “dense,” sensing to what a degree a stone is foreign and irreducible to us, with what intensity nature or a landscape can negate us.  At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman, and these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this very minute lose the illusory meaning with which we had clothed them, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise.  The primitive hostility of the world rises up to face us across millennia.  For a second we cease to understand it because for centuries we have understood in it solely the images and designs that we had attributed to it beforehand, because henceforth we lack the power to make use of that artifice.  The world evades us because it becomes itself again.  That stage scenery masked by habit becomes again what it is.  It withdraws at a distance from us.  Just as there are days when under the familiar face of a woman, we see as a stranger her we had loved months or years ago, perhaps we shall come even to desire what suddenly leaves us so alone.  But the time has not yet come.  Just one thing: that denseness and that strangeness of the world is the absurd.  Men, too, secrete the inhuman.  At certain moments of lucidity, the mechanical aspect of their gestures, their meaningless pantomime makes silly everything that surrounds them.  A man is talking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, but you see his incomprehensible dumb show: you wonder why he is alive.  This discomfort in the face of man’s own inhumanity, this incalculable tumble before the image of what we are, this “nausea,” as a writer of today calls it, is also the absurd.  Likewise the stranger who at certain seconds comes to meet us in a mirror, the familiar and yet alarming brother we encounter in our own photographs is also the absurd.  I come at last to death and to the attitude we have toward it.  On this point everything has been said and it is only proper to avoid pathos.  Yet one will never be sufficiently surprised that everyone lives as if no one “knew.” This is because in reality there is no experience of death.  Properly speaking, nothing has been experienced but what has been lived and made conscious.  Here, it is barely possible to speak of the experience of others’ deaths.  It is a substitute, an illusion, and it never quite convinces us.  That melancholy convention cannot be persuasive.  The horror comes in reality from the mathematical aspect of the event.  If time frightens us, this is because it works out the problem and the solution comes afterward.  All the pretty speeches about the soul will have their contrary convincingly proved, at least for a time.  From this inert body on which a slap makes no mark the soul has disappeared.  This elementary and definitive aspect of the adventure constitutes the absurd feeling.  Under the fatal lighting of that destiny, its uselessness becomes evident.  No code of ethics and no effort are justifiable a priori in the face of the cruel mathematics that command our condition.  Let me repeat: all this has been said over and over.  I am limiting myself here to making a rapid classification and to pointing out these obvious themes.  They run through all literatures and all philosophies.  Everyday conversation feeds on them.  There is no question of reinventing them.  But it is essential to be sure of these facts in order to be able to question oneself subsequently on the primordial question.  I am interested—let me repeat again—not so much in absurd discoveries as in their consequences.  If one is assured of these facts, what is one to conclude, how far is one to go to elude nothing? Is one to die voluntarily or to hope in spite of everything? Beforehand, it is necessary to take the same rapid inventory on the plane of the intelligence.  * * * The mind’s first step is to distinguish what is true from what is false.  However, as soon as thought reflects on itself, what it first discovers is a contradiction.  Useless to strive to be convincing in this case.  Over the centuries no one has furnished a clearer and more elegant demonstration of the business than Aristotle: “The often ridiculed consequence of these opinions is that they destroy themselves.  For by asserting that all is true we assert the truth of the contrary assertion and consequently the falsity of our own thesis (for the contrary assertion does not admit that it can be true).  And if one says that all is false, that assertion is itself false.  If we declare that solely the assertion opposed to ours is false or else that solely ours is not false, we are nevertheless forced to admit an infinite number of true or false judgments.  For the one who expresses a true assertion proclaims simultaneously that it is true, and so on ad infinitum .” This vicious circle is but the first of a series in which the mind that studies itself gets lost in a giddy whirling.  The very simplicity of these paradoxes makes them irreducible.  Whatever may be the plays on words and the acrobatics of logic, to understand is, above all, to unify.  The mind’s deepest desire, even in its most elaborate operations, parallels man’s unconscious feeling in the face of his universe: it is an insistence upon familiarity, an appetite for clarity.  Understanding the world for a man is reducing it to the human, stamping it with his seal.  The cat’s universe is not the universe of the anthill.  The truism “All thought is anthropomorphic” has no other meaning.  Likewise, the mind that aims to understand reality can consider itself satisfied only by reducing it to terms of thought.  If man realized that the universe like him can love and suffer, he would be reconciled.  If thought discovered in the shimmering mirrors of phenomena eternal relations capable of summing them up and summing themselves up in a single principle, then would be seen an intellectual joy of which the myth of the blessed would be but a ridiculous imitation.  That nostalgia for unity, that appetite for the absolute illustrates the essential impulse of the human drama.  But the fact of that nostalgia’s existence does not imply that it is to be immediately satisfied.  For if, bridging the gulf that separates desire from conquest, we assert with Parmenides the reality of the One (whatever it may be), we fall into the ridiculous contradiction of a mind that asserts total unity and proves by its very assertion its own difference and the diversity it claimed to resolve.  This other vicious circle is enough to stifle our hopes.  These are again truisms.  I shall again repeat that they are not interesting in themselves but in the consequences that can be deduced from them.  I know another truism: it tells me that man is mortal.  One can nevertheless count the minds that have deduced the extreme conclusions from it.  It is essential to consider as a constant point of reference in this essay the regular hiatus between what we fancy we know and what we really know, practical assent and simulated ignorance which allows us to live with ideas which, if we truly put them to the test, ought to upset our whole life.  Faced with this inextricable contradiction of the mind, we shall fully grasp the divorce separating us from our own creations.  So long as the mind keeps silent in the motionless world of its hopes, everything is reflected and arranged in the unity of its nostalgia.  But with its first move this world cracks and tumbles: an infinite number of shimmering fragments is offered to the understanding.  We must despair of ever reconstructing the familiar, calm surface which would give us peace of heart.  After so many centuries of inquiries, so many abdications among thinkers, we are well aware that this is true for all our knowledge.  With the exception of professional rationalists, today people despair of true knowledge.  If the only significant history of human thought were to be written, it would have to be the history of its successive regrets and its impotences.  Of whom and of what indeed can I say: “I know that!” This heart within me I can feel, and I judge that it exists.  This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it exists.  There ends all my knowledge, and the rest is construction.  For if I try to seize this self of which I feel sure, if I try to define and to summarize it, it is nothing but water slipping through my fingers.  I can sketch one by one all the aspects it is able to assume, all those likewise that have been attributed to it, this upbringing, this origin, this ardor or these silences, this nobility or this vileness.  But aspects cannot be added up.  This very heart which is mine will forever remain indefinable to me.  Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will never be filled.  Forever I shall be a stranger to myself.  In psychology as in logic, there are truths but no truth.  Socrates’ “Know thyself” has as much value as the “Be virtuous” of our confessionals.  They reveal a nostalgia at the same time as an ignorance.  They are sterile exercises on great subjects.  They are legitimate only in precisely so far as they are approximate.  And here are trees and I know their gnarled surface, water and I feel its taste.  These scents of grass and stars at night, certain evenings when the heart relaxes—how shall I negate this world whose power and strength I feel? Yet all the knowledge on earth will give me nothing to assure me that this world is mine.  You describe it to me and you teach me to classify it.  You enumerate its laws and in my thirst for knowledge I admit that they are true.  You take apart its mechanism and my hope increases.  At the final stage you teach me that this wondrous and multicolored universe can be reduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the electron.  All this is good and I wait for you to continue.  But you tell me of an invisible planetary system in which electrons gravitate around a nucleus.  You explain this world to me with an image.  I realize then that you have been reduced to poetry: I shall never know.  Have I the time to become indignant? You have already changed theories.  So that science that was to teach me everything ends up in a hypothesis, that lucidity founders in metaphor, that uncertainty is resolved in a work of art.  What need had I of so many efforts? The soft lines of these hills and the hand of evening on this troubled heart teach me much more.  I have returned to my beginning.  I realize that if through science I can seize phenomena and enumerate them, I cannot, for all that, apprehend the world.  Were I to trace its entire relief with my finger, I should not know any more.  And you give me the choice between a description that is sure but that teaches me nothing and hypotheses that claim to teach me but that are not sure.  A stranger to myself and to the world, armed solely with a thought that negates itself as soon as it asserts, what is this condition in which I can have peace only by refusing to know and to live, in which the appetite for conquest bumps into walls that defy its assaults? To will is to stir up paradoxes.  Everything is ordered in such a way as to bring into being that poisoned peace produced by thoughtlessness, lack of heart, or fatal renunciations.  Hence the intelligence, too, tells me in its way that this world is absurd.  Its contrary, blind reason, may well claim that all is clear; I was waiting for proof and longing for it to be right.  But despite so many pretentious centuries and over the heads of so many eloquent and persuasive men, I know that is false.  On this plane, at least, there is no happiness if I cannot know.  That universal reason, practical or ethical, that determinism, those categories that explain everything are enough to make a decent man laugh.  They have nothing to do with the mind.  They negate its profound truth, which is to be enchained.  In this unintelligible and limited universe, man’s fate henceforth assumes its meaning.  A horde of irrationals has sprung up and surrounds him until his ultimate end.  In his recovered and now studied lucidity, the feeling of the absurd becomes clear and definite.  I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty.  This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said.  But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart.  The absurd depends as much on man as on the world.  For the moment it is all that links them together.  It binds them one to the other as only hatred can weld two creatures together.  This is all I can discern clearly in this measureless universe where my adventure takes place.  Let us pause here.  If I hold to be true that absurdity that determines my relationship with life, if I become thoroughly imbued with that sentiment that seizes me in face of the world’s scenes, with that lucidity imposed on me by the pursuit of a science, I must sacrifice everything to these certainties and I must see them squarely to be able to maintain them.  Above all, I must adapt my behavior to them and pursue them in all their consequences.  I am speaking here of decency.  But I want to know beforehand if thought can live in those deserts.  * * * I already know that thought has at least entered those deserts.  There it found its bread.  There it realized that it had previously been feeding on phantoms.  It justified some of the most urgent themes of human reflection.  From the moment absurdity is recognized, it becomes a passion, the most harrowing of all.  But whether or not one can live with one’s passions, whether or not one can accept their law, which is to burn the heart they simultaneously exalt—that is the whole question.  It is not, however, the one we shall ask just yet.  It stands at the center of this experience.  There will be time to come back to it.  Let us recognize rather those themes and those impulses born of the desert.  It will suffice to enumerate them.  They, too, are known to all today.  There have always been men to defend the rights of the irrational.  The tradition of what may be called humiliated thought has never ceased to exist.  The criticism of rationalism has been made so often that it seems unnecessary to begin again.  Yet our epoch is marked by the rebirth of those paradoxical systems that strive to trip up the reason as if truly it had always forged ahead.  But that is not so much a proof of the efficacy of the reason as of the intensity of its hopes.  On the plane of history, such a constancy of two attitudes illustrates the essential passion of man torn between his urge toward unity and the clear vision he may have of the walls enclosing him.  But never perhaps at any time has the attack on reason been more violent than in ours.  Since Zarathustra’s great outburst: “By chance it is the oldest nobility in the world.  I conferred it upon all things when I proclaimed that above them no eternal will was exercised,” since Kierkegaard’s fatal illness, “that malady that leads to death with nothing else following it,” the significant and tormenting themes of absurd thought have followed one another.  Or at least, and this proviso is of capital importance, the themes of irrational and religious thought.  From Jaspers to Heidegger, from Kierkegaard to Chestov, from the phenomenologists to Scheler, on the logical plane and on the moral plane, a whole family of minds related by their nostalgia but opposed by their methods or their aims, have persisted in blocking the royal road of reason and in recovering the direct paths of truth.  Here I assume these thoughts to be known and lived.  Whatever may be or have been their ambitions, all started out from that indescribable universe where contradiction, antinomy, anguish, or impotence reigns.  And what they have in common is precisely the themes so far disclosed.  For them, too, it must be said that what matters above all is the conclusions they have managed to draw from those discoveries.  That matters so much that they must be examined separately.  But for the moment we are concerned solely with their discoveries and their initial experiments.  We are concerned solely with noting their agreement.  If it would be presumptuous to try to deal with their philosophies, it is possible and sufficient in any case to bring out the climate that is common to them.  Heidegger considers the human condition coldly and announces that that existence is humiliated.  The only reality is “anxiety” in the whole chain of beings.  To the man lost in the world and its diversions this anxiety is a brief, fleeting fear.  But if that fear becomes conscious of itself, it becomes anguish, the perpetual climate of the lucid man “in whom existence is concentrated.” This professor of philosophy writes without trembling and in the most abstract language in the world that “the finite and limited character of human existence is more primordial than man himself.” His interest in Kant extends only to recognizing the restricted character of his “pure Reason.” This is to conclude at the end of his analyses that “the world can no longer offer anything to the man filled with anguish.” This anxiety seems to him so much more important than all the categories in the world that he thinks and talks only of it.  He enumerates its aspects: boredom when the ordinary man strives to quash it in him and benumb it; terror when the mind contemplates death.  He too does not separate consciousness from the absurd.  The consciousness of death is the call of anxiety and “existence then delivers itself its own summons through the intermediary of consciousness.” It is the very voice of anguish and it adjures existence “to return from its loss in the anonymous They.” For him, too, one must not sleep, but must keep alert until the consummation.  He stands in this absurd world and points out its ephemeral character.  He seeks his way amid these ruins.  Jaspers despairs of any ontology because he claims that we have lost “naïveté.” He knows that we can achieve nothing that will transcend the fatal game of appearances.  He knows that the end of the mind is failure.  He tarries over the spiritual adventures revealed by history and pitilessly discloses the flaw in each system, the illusion that saved everything, the preaching that hid nothing.  In this ravaged world in which the impossibility of knowledge is established, in which everlasting nothingness seems the only reality and irremediable despair seems the only attitude, he tries to recover the Ariadne’s thread that leads to divine secrets.  Chestov, for his part, throughout a wonderfully monotonous work, constantly straining toward the same truths, tirelessly demonstrates that the tightest system, the most universal rationalism always stumbles eventually on the irrational of human thought.  None of the ironic facts or ridiculous contradictions that depreciate the reason escapes him.  One thing only interests him, and that is the exception, whether in the domain of the heart or of the mind.  Through the Dostoevskian experiences of the condemned man, the exacerbated adventures of the Nietzschean mind, Hamlet’s imprecations, or the bitter aristocracy of an Ibsen, he tracks down, illuminates, and magnifies the human revolt against the irremediable.  He refuses the reason its reasons and begins to advance with some decision only in the middle of that colorless desert where all certainties have become stones.  Of all perhaps the most engaging, Kierkegaard, for a part of his existence at least, does more than discover the absurd, he lives it.  The man who writes: “The surest of stubborn silences is not to hold one’s tongue but to talk” makes sure in the beginning that no truth is absolute or can render satisfactory an existence that is impossible in itself.  Don Juan of the understanding, he multiplies pseudonyms and contradictions, writes his Discourses of Edification at the same time as that manual of cynical spiritualism, The Diary of the Seducer .  He refuses consolations, ethics, reliable principles.  As for that thorn he feels in his heart, he is careful not to quiet its pain.  On the contrary, he awakens it and, in the desperate joy of a man crucified and happy to be so, he builds up piece by piece—lucidity, refusal, make-believe—a category of the man possessed.  That face both tender and sneering, those pirouettes followed by a cry from the heart are the absurd spirit itself grappling with a reality beyond its comprehension.  And the spiritual adventure that leads Kierkegaard to his beloved scandals begins likewise in the chaos of an experience divested of its setting and relegated to its original incoherence.  On quite a different plane, that of method, Husserl and the phenomenologists, by their very extravagances, reinstate the world in its diversity and deny the transcendent power of the reason.  The spiritual universe becomes incalculably enriched through them.  The rose petal, the milestone, or the human hand are as important as love, desire, or the laws of gravity.  Thinking ceases to be unifying or making a semblance familiar in the guise of a major principle.  Thinking is learning all over again to see, to be attentive, to focus consciousness; it is turning every idea and every image, in the manner of Proust, into a privileged moment.  What justifies thought is its extreme consciousness.  Though more positive than Kierkegaard’s or Chestov’s, Husserl’s manner of proceeding, in the beginning, nevertheless negates the classic method of the reason, disappoints hope, opens to intuition and to the heart a whole proliferation of phenomena, the wealth of which has about it something inhuman.  These paths lead to all sciences or to none.  This amounts to saying that in this case the means are more important than the end.  All that is involved is “an attitude for understanding” and not a consolation.  Let me repeat: in the beginning, at very least.  How can one fail to feel the basic relationship of these minds! How can one fail to see that they take their stand around a privileged and bitter moment in which hope has no further place? I want everything to be explained to me or nothing.  And the reason is impotent when it hears this cry from the heart.  The mind aroused by this insistence seeks and finds nothing but contradictions and nonsense.  What I fail to understand is nonsense.  The world is peopled with such irrationals.  The world itself, whose single meaning I do not understand, is but a vast irrational.  If one could only say just once: “This is clear,” all would be saved.  But these men vie with one another in proclaiming that nothing is clear, all is chaos, that all man has is his lucidity and his definite knowledge of the walls surrounding him.  All these experiences agree and confirm one another.  The mind, when it reaches its limits, must make a judgment and choose its conclusions.  This is where suicide and the reply stand.  But I wish to reverse the order of the inquiry and start out from the intelligent adventure and come back to daily acts.  The experiences called to mind here were born in the desert that we must not leave behind.  At least it is essential to know how far they went.  At this point of his effort man stands face to face with the irrational.  He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason.  The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.  This must not be forgotten.  This must be clung to because the whole consequence of a life can depend on it.  The irrational, the human nostalgia, and the absurd that is born of their encounter—these are the three characters in the drama that must necessarily end with all the logic of which an existence is capable.  Philosophical Suicide The feeling of the absurd is not, for all that, the notion of the absurd.  It lays the foundations for it, and that is all.  It is not limited to that notion, except in the brief moment when it passes judgment on the universe.  Subsequently it has a chance of going further.  It is alive; in other words, it must die or else reverberate.  So it is with the themes we have gathered together.  But there again what interests me is not works or minds, criticism of which would call for another form and another place, but the discovery of what their conclusions have in common.  Never, perhaps, have minds been so different.  And yet we recognize as identical the spiritual landscapes in which they get under way.  Likewise, despite such dissimilar zones of knowledge, the cry that terminates their itinerary rings out in the same way.  It is evident that the thinkers we have just recalled have a common climate.  To say that that climate is deadly scarcely amounts to playing on words.  Living under that stifling sky forces one to get away or to stay.  The important thing is to find out how people get away in the first case and why people stay in the second case.  This is how I define the problem of suicide and the possible interest in the conclusions of existential philosophy.  But first I want to detour from the direct path.  Up to now we have managed to circumscribe the absurd from the outside.  One can, however, wonder how much is clear in that notion and by direct analysis try to discover its meaning on the one hand and, on the other, the consequences it involves.  If I accuse an innocent man of a monstrous crime, if I tell a virtuous man that he has coveted his own sister, he will reply that this is absurd.  His indignation has its comical aspect.  But it also has its fundamental reason.  The virtuous man illustrates by that reply the definitive antinomy existing between the deed I am attributing to him and his lifelong principles.  “It’s absurd” means “It’s impossible” but also “It’s contradictory.” If I see a man armed only with a sword attack a group of machine guns, I shall consider his act to be absurd.  But it is so solely by virtue of the disproportion between his intention and the reality he will encounter, of the contradiction I notice between his true strength and the aim he has in view.  Likewise we shall deem a verdict absurd when we contrast it with the verdict the facts apparently dictated.  And, similarly, a demonstration by the absurd is achieved by comparing the consequences of such a reasoning with the logical reality one wants to set up.  In all these cases, from the simplest to the most complex, the magnitude of the absurdity will be in direct ratio to the distance between the two terms of my comparison.  There are absurd marriages, challenges, rancors, silences, wars, and even peace treaties.  For each of them the absurdity springs from a comparison.  I am thus justified in saying that the feeling of absurdity does not spring from the mere scrutiny of a fact or an impression, but that it bursts from the comparison between a bare fact and a certain reality, between an action and the world that transcends it.  The absurd is essentially a divorce.  It lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their confrontation.  In this particular case and on the plane of intelligence, I can therefore say that the Absurd is not in man (if such a metaphor could have a meaning) nor in the world, but in their presence together.  For the moment it is the only bond uniting them.  If I wish to limit myself to facts, I know what man wants, I know what the world offers him, and now I can say that I also know what links them.  I have no need to dig deeper.  A single certainty is enough for the seeker.  He simply has to derive all the consequences from it.  The immediate consequence is also a rule of method.  The odd trinity brought to light in this way is certainly not a startling discovery.  But it resembles the data of experience in that it is both infinitely simple and infinitely complicated.  Its first distinguishing feature in this regard is that it cannot be divided.  To destroy one of its terms is to destroy the whole.  There can be no absurd outside the human mind.  Thus, like everything else, the absurd ends with death.  But there can be no absurd outside this world either.  And it is by this elementary criterion that I judge the notion of the absurd to be essential and consider that it can stand as the first of my truths.  The rule of method alluded to above appears here.  If I judge that a thing is true, I must preserve it.  If I attempt to solve a problem, at least I must not by that very solution conjure away one of the terms of the problem.  For me the sole datum is the absurd.  The first and, after all, the only condition of my inquiry is to preserve the very thing that crushes me, consequently to respect what I consider essential in it.  I have just defined it as a confrontation and an unceasing struggle.  And carrying this absurd logic to its conclusion, I must admit that that struggle implies a total absence of hope (which has nothing to do with despair), a continual rejection (which must not be confused with renunciation), and a conscious dissatisfaction (which must not be compared to immature unrest).  Everything that destroys, conjures away, or exorcises these requirements (and, to begin with, consent which overthrows divorce) ruins the absurd and devaluates the attitude that may then be proposed.  The absurd has meaning only in so far as it is not agreed to.  * * * There exists an obvious fact that seems utterly moral: namely, that a man is always a prey to his truths.  Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them.  One has to pay something.  A man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it.  A man devoid of hope and conscious of being so has ceased to belong to the future.  That is natural.  But it is just as natural that he should strive to escape the universe of which he is the creator.  All the foregoing has significance only on account of this paradox.  Certain men, starting from a critique of rationalism, have admitted the absurd climate.  Nothing is more instructive in this regard than to scrutinize the way in which they have elaborated their consequences.  Now, to limit myself to existential philosophies, I see that all of them without exception suggest escape.  Through an odd reasoning, starting out from the absurd over the ruins of reason, in a closed universe limited to the human, they deify what crushes them and find reason to hope in what impoverishes them.  That forced hope is religious in all of them.  It deserves attention.  I shall merely analyze here as examples a few themes dear to Chestov and Kierkegaard.  But Jaspers will provide us, in caricatural form, a typical example of this attitude.  As a result the rest will be clearer.  He is left powerless to realize the transcendent, incapable of plumbing the depth of experience, and conscious of that universe upset by failure.  Will he advance or at least draw the conclusions from that failure? He contributes nothing new.  He has found nothing in experience but the confession of his own impotence and no occasion to infer any satisfactory principle.  Yet without justification, as he says to himself, he suddenly asserts all at once the transcendent, the essence of experience, and the superhuman significance of life when he writes: “Does not the failure reveal, beyond any possible explanation and interpretation, not the absence but the existence of transcendence?” That existence which, suddenly and through a blind act of human confidence, explains everything, he defines as “the unthinkable unity of the general and the particular.” Thus the absurd becomes god (in the broadest meaning of this word) and that inability to understand becomes the existence that illuminates everything.  Nothing logically prepares this reasoning.  I can call it a leap.  And paradoxically can be understood Jaspers’s insistence, his infinite patience devoted to making the experience of the transcendent impossible to realize.  For the more fleeting that approximation is, the more empty that definition proves to be, and the more real that transcendent is to him; for the passion he devotes to asserting it is in direct proportion to the gap between his powers of explanation and the irrationality of the world and of experience.  It thus appears that the more bitterly Jaspers destroys the reason’s preconceptions, the more radically he will explain the world.  That apostle of humiliated thought will find at the very end of humiliation the means of regenerating being to its very depth.  Mystical thought has familiarized us with such devices.  They are just as legitimate as any attitude of mind.  But for the moment I am acting as if I took a certain problem seriously.  Without judging beforehand the general value of this attitude or its educative power, I mean simply to consider whether it answers the conditions I set myself, whether it is worthy of the conflict that concerns me.  Thus I return to Chestov.  A commentator relates a remark of his that deserves interest: “The only true solution,” he said, “is precisely where human judgment sees no solution.  Otherwise, what need would we have of God? We turn toward God only to obtain the impossible.  As for the possible, men suffice.” If there is a Chestovian philosophy, I can say that it is altogether summed up in this way.  For when, at the conclusion of his passionate analyses, Chestov discovers the fundamental absurdity of all existence, he does not say: “This is the absurd,” but rather: “This is God: we must rely on him even if he does not correspond to any of our rational categories.” So that confusion may not be possible, the Russian philosopher even hints that this God is perhaps full of hatred and hateful, incomprehensible and contradictory; but the more hideous is his face, the more he asserts his power.  His greatness is his incoherence.  His proof is his inhumanity.  One must spring into him and by this leap free oneself from rational illusions.  Thus, for Chestov acceptance of the absurd is contemporaneous with the absurd itself.  Being aware of it amounts to accepting it, and the whole logical effort of his thought is to bring it out so that at the same time the tremendous hope it involves may burst forth.  Let me repeat that this attitude is legitimate.  But I am persisting here in considering a single problem and all its consequences.  I do not have to examine the emotion of a thought or of an act of faith.  I have a whole lifetime to do that.  I know that the rationalist finds Chestov’s attitude annoying.  But I also feel that Chestov is right rather than the rationalist, and I merely want to know if he remains faithful to the commandments of the absurd.  Now, if it is admitted that the absurd is the contrary of hope, it is seen that existential thought for Chestov presupposes the absurd but proves it only to dispel it.  Such subtlety of thought is a conjuror’s emotional trick.  When Chestov elsewhere sets his absurd in opposition to current morality and reason, he calls it truth and redemption.  Hence, there is basically in that definition of the absurd an approbation that Chestov grants it.  If it is admitted that all the power of that notion lies in the way it runs counter to our elementary hopes, if it is felt that to remain, the absurd requires not to be consented to, then it can be clearly seen that it has lost its true aspect, its human and relative character in order to enter an eternity that is both incomprehensible and satisfying.  If there is an absurd, it is in man’s universe.  The moment the notion transforms itself into eternity’s springboard, it ceases to be linked to human lucidity.  The absurd is no longer that evidence that man ascertains without consenting to it.  The struggle is eluded.  Man integrates the absurd and in that communion causes to disappear its essential character, which is opposition, laceration, and divorce.  This leap is an escape.  Chestov, who is so fond of quoting Hamlet’s remark: “The time is out of joint,” writes it down with a sort of savage hope that seems to belong to him in particular.  For it is not in this sense that Hamlet says it or Shakespeare writes it.  The intoxication of the irrational and the vocation of rapture turn a lucid mind away from the absurd.  To Chestov reason is useless but there is something beyond reason.  To an absurd mind reason is useless and there is nothing beyond reason.  This leap can at least enlighten us a little more as to the true nature of the absurd.  We know that it is worthless except in an equilibrium, that it is, above all, in the comparison and not in the terms of that comparison.  But it so happens that Chestov puts all the emphasis on one of the terms and destroys the equilibrium.  Our appetite for understanding, our nostalgia for the absolute are explicable only in so far, precisely, as we can understand and explain many things.  It is useless to negate the reason absolutely.  It has its order in which it is efficacious.  It is properly that of human experience.  Whence we wanted to make everything clear.  If we cannot do so, if the absurd is born on that occasion, it is born precisely at the very meeting-point of that efficacious but limited reason with the ever resurgent irrational.  Now, when Chestov rises up against a Hegelian proposition such as “the motion of the solar system takes place in conformity with immutable laws and those laws are its reason,” when he devotes all his passion to upsetting Spinoza’s rationalism, he concludes, in effect, in favor of the vanity of all reason.  Whence, by a natural and illegitimate reversal, to the pre-eminence of the irrational.  *5 But the transition is not evident.  For here may intervene the notion of limit and the notion of level.  The laws of nature may be operative up to a certain limit, beyond which they turn against themselves to give birth to the absurd.  Or else, they may justify themselves on the level of description without for that reason being true on the level of explanation.  Everything is sacrificed here to the irrational, and, the demand for clarity being conjured away, the absurd disappears with one of the terms of its comparison.  The absurd man, on the other hand, does not undertake such a leveling process.  He recognizes the struggle, does not absolutely scorn reason, and admits the irrational.  Thus he again embraces in a single glance all the data of experience and he is little inclined to leap before knowing.  He knows simply that in that alert awareness there is no further place for hope.  What is perceptible in Leo Chestov will be perhaps even more so in Kierkegaard.  To be sure, it is hard to outline clear propositions in so elusive a writer.  But, despite apparently opposed writings, beyond the pseudonyms, the tricks, and the smiles, can be felt throughout that work, as it were, the presentiment (at the same time as the apprehension) of a truth which eventually bursts forth in the last works: Kierkegaard likewise takes the leap.  His childhood having been so frightened by Christianity, he ultimately returns to its harshest aspect.  For him, too, antinomy and paradox become criteria of the religious.  Thus, the very thing that led to despair of the meaning and depth of this life now gives it its truth and its clarity.  Christianity is the scandal, and what Kierkegaard calls for quite plainly is the third sacrifice required by Ignatius Loyola, the one in which God most rejoices: “The sacrifice of the intellect.” *6 This effect of the “leap” is odd, but must not surprise us any longer.  He makes of the absurd the criterion of the other world, whereas it is simply a residue of the experience of this world.  “In his failure,” says Kierkegaard, “the believer finds his triumph.” It is not for me to wonder to what stirring preaching this attitude is linked.  I merely have to wonder if the spectacle of the absurd and its own character justifies it.  On this point, I know that it is not so.  Upon considering again the content of the absurd, one understands better the method that inspired Kierkegaard.  Between the irrational of the world and the insurgent nostalgia of the absurd, he does not maintain the equilibrium.  He does not respect the relationship that constitutes, properly speaking, the feeling of absurdity.  Sure of being unable to escape the irrational, he wants at least to save himself from that desperate nostalgia that seems to him sterile and devoid of implication.  But if he may be right on this point in his judgment, he could not be in his negation.  If he substitutes for his cry of revolt a frantic adherence, at once he is led to blind himself to the absurd which hitherto enlightened him and to deify the only certainty he henceforth possesses, the irrational.  The important thing, as Abbé Galiani said to Mme d’Epinay, is not to be cured, but to live with one’s ailments.  Kierkegaard wants to be cured.  To be cured is his frenzied wish, and it runs throughout his whole journal.  The entire effort of his intelligence is to escape the antinomy of the human condition.  An all the more desperate effort since he intermittently perceives its vanity when he speaks of himself, as if neither fear of God nor piety were capable of bringing him to peace.  Thus it is that, through a strained subterfuge, he gives the irrational the appearance and God the attributes of the absurd: unjust, incoherent, and incomprehensible.  Intelligence alone in him strives to stifle the underlying demands of the human heart.  Since nothing is proved, everything can be proved.  Indeed, Kierkegaard himself shows us the path taken.  I do not want to suggest anything here, but how can one fail to read in his works the signs of an almost intentional mutilation of the soul to balance the mutilation accepted in regard to the absurd? It is the leitmotiv of the Journal .  “What I lacked was the animal which also belongs to human destiny….But give me a body then.” And further on: “Oh! especially in my early youth what should I not have given to be a man, even for six months…what I lack, basically, is a body and the physical conditions of existence.” Elsewhere, the same man nevertheless adopts the great cry of hope that has come down through so many centuries and quickened so many hearts, except that of the absurd man.  “But for the Christian death is certainly not the end of everything and it implies infinitely more hope than life implies for us, even when that life is overflowing with health and vigor.” Reconciliation through scandal is still reconciliation.  It allows one perhaps, as can be seen, to derive hope of its contrary, which is death.  But even if fellow-feeling inclines one toward that attitude, still it must be said that excess justifies nothing.  That transcends, as the saying goes, the human scale; therefore it must be superhuman.  But this “therefore” is superfluous.  There is no logical certainty here.  There is no experimental probability either.  All I can say is that, in fact, that transcends my scale.  If I do not draw a negation from it, at least I do not want to found anything on the incomprehensible.  I want to know whether I can live with what I know and with that alone.  I am told again that here the intelligence must sacrifice its pride and the reason bow down.  But if I recognize the limits of the reason, I do not therefore negate it, recognizing its relative powers.  I merely want to remain in this middle path where the intelligence can remain clear.  If that is its pride, I see no sufficient reason for giving it up.  Nothing more profound, for example, than Kierkegaard’s view according to which despair is not a fact but a state: the very state of sin.  For sin is what alienates from God.  The absurd, which is the metaphysical state of the conscious man, does not lead to God.  *7 Perhaps this notion will become clearer if I risk this shocking statement: the absurd is sin without God.  It is a matter of living in that state of the absurd.  I know on what it is founded, this mind and this world straining against each other without being able to embrace each other.  I ask for the rule of life of that state, and what I am offered neglects its basis, negates one of the terms of the painful opposition, demands of me a resignation.  I ask what is involved in the condition I recognize as mine; I know it implies obscurity and ignorance; and I am assured that this ignorance explains everything and that this darkness is my light.  But there is no reply here to my intent, and this stirring lyricism cannot hide the paradox from me.  One must therefore turn away.  Kierkegaard may shout in warning: “If man had no eternal consciousness, if, at the bottom of everything, there were merely a wild, seething force producing everything, both large and trifling, in the storm of dark passions, if the bottomless void that nothing can fill underlay all things, what would life be but despair?” This cry is not likely to stop the absurd man.  Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable.  If in order to elude the anxious question: “What would life be?” one must, like the donkey, feed on the roses of illusion, then the absurd mind, rather than resigning itself to falsehood, prefers to adopt fearlessly Kierkegaard’s reply: “despair.” Everything considered, a determined soul will always manage.  * * * I am taking the liberty at this point of calling the existential attitude philosophical suicide.  But this does not imply a judgment.  It is a convenient way of indicating the movement by which a thought negates itself and tends to transcend itself in its very negation.  For the existentials negation is their God.  To be precise, that god is maintained only through the negation of human reason.  *8 But, like suicides, gods change with men.  There are many ways of leaping, the essential being to leap.  Those redeeming negations, those ultimate contradictions which negate the obstacle that has not yet been leaped over, may spring just as well (this is the paradox at which this reasoning aims) from a certain religious inspiration as from the rational order.  They always lay claim to the eternal, and it is solely in this that they take the leap.  It must be repeated that the reasoning developed in this essay leaves out altogether the most widespread spiritual attitude of our enlightened age: the one, based on the principle that all is reason, which aims to explain the world.  It is natural to give a clear view of the world after accepting the idea that it must be clear.  That is even legitimate, but does not concern the reasoning we are following out here.  In fact, our aim is to shed light upon the step taken by the mind when, starting from a philosophy of the world’s lack of meaning, it ends up by finding a meaning and depth in it.  The most touching of those steps is religious in essence; it becomes obvious in the theme of the irrational.  But the most paradoxical and most significant is certainly the one that attributes rational reasons to a world it originally imagined as devoid of any guiding principle.  It is impossible in any case to reach the consequences that concern us without having given an idea of this new attainment of the spirit of nostalgia.  I shall examine merely the theme of “the Intention” made fashionable by Husserl and the phenomenologists.  I have already alluded to it.  Originally Husserl’s method negates the classic procedure of the reason.  Let me repeat.  Thinking is not unifying or making the appearance familiar under the guise of a great principle.  Thinking is learning all over again how to see, directing one’s consciousness, making of every image a privileged place.  In other words, phenomenology declines to explain the world, it wants to be merely a description of actual experience.  It confirms absurd thought in its initial assertion that there is no truth, but merely truths.  From the evening breeze to this hand on my shoulder, everything has its truth.  Consciousness illuminates it by paying attention to it.  Consciousness does not form the object of its understanding, it merely focuses, it is the act of attention, and, to borrow a Bergsonian image, it resembles the projector that suddenly focuses on an image.  The difference is that there is no scenario, but a successive and incoherent illustration.  In that magic lantern all the pictures are privileged.  Consciousness suspends in experience the objects of its attention.  Through its miracle it isolates them.  Henceforth they are beyond all judgments.  This is the “intention” that characterizes consciousness.  But the word does not imply any idea of finality; it is taken in its sense of “direction”: its only value is topographical.  At first sight, it certainly seems that in this way nothing contradicts the absurd spirit.  That apparent modesty of thought that limits itself to describing what it declines to explain, that intentional discipline whence result paradoxically a profound enrichment of experience and the rebirth of the world in its prolixity are absurd procedures.  At least at first sight.  For methods of thought, in this case as elsewhere, always assume two aspects, one psychological and the other metaphysical.  *9 Thereby they harbor two truths.  If the theme of the intentional claims to illustrate merely a psychological attitude, by which reality is drained instead of being explained, nothing in fact separates it from the absurd spirit.  It aims to enumerate what it cannot transcend.  It affirms solely that without any unifying principle thought can still take delight in describing and understanding every aspect of experience.  The truth involved then for each of those aspects is psychological in nature.  It simply testifies to the “interest” that reality can offer.  It is a way of awaking a sleeping world and of making it vivid to the mind.  But if one attempts to extend and give a rational basis to that notion of truth, if one claims to discover in this way the “essence” of each object of knowledge, one restores its depth to experience.  For an absurd mind that is incomprehensible.  Now, it is this wavering between modesty and assurance that is noticeable in the intentional attitude, and this shimmering of phenomenological thought will illustrate the absurd reasoning better than anything else.  For Husserl speaks likewise of “extra-temporal essences” brought to light by the intention, and he sounds like Plato.  All things are not explained by one thing but by all things.  I see no difference.  To be sure, those ideas or those essences that consciousness “effectuates” at the end of every description are not yet to be considered perfect models.  But it is asserted that they are directly present in each datum of perception.  There is no longer a single idea explaining everything, but an infinite number of essences giving a meaning to an infinite number of objects.  The world comes to a stop, but also lights up.  Platonic realism becomes intuitive, but it is still realism.  Kierkegaard was swallowed up in his God; Parmenides plunged thought into the One.  But here thought hurls itself into an abstract polytheism.  But this is not all: hallucinations and fictions likewise belong to “extra-temporal essences.” In the new world of ideas, the species of centaurs collaborates with the more modest species of metropolitan man.  For the absurd man, there was a truth as well as a bitterness in that purely psychological opinion that all aspects of the world are privileged.  To say that everything is privileged is tantamount to saying that everything is equivalent.  But the metaphysical aspect of that truth is so far-reaching that through an elementary reaction he feels closer perhaps to Plato.  He is taught, in fact, that every image presupposes an equally privileged essence.  In this ideal world without hierarchy, the formal army is composed solely of generals.  To be sure, transcendency had been eliminated.  But a sudden shift in thought brings back into the world a sort of fragmentary immanence which restores to the universe its depth.  Am I to fear having carried too far a theme handled with greater circumspection by its creators? I read merely these assertions of Husserl, apparently paradoxical yet rigorously logical if what precedes is accepted: “That which is true is true absolutely, in itself; truth is one, identical with itself, however different the creatures who perceive it, men, monsters, angels or gods.” Reason triumphs and trumpets forth with that voice, I cannot deny.  What can its assertions mean in the absurd world? The perception of an angel or a god has no meaning for me.  That geometrical spot where divine reason ratifies mine will always be incomprehensible to me.  There, too, I discern a leap, and though performed in the abstract, it nonetheless means for me forgetting just what I do not want to forget.  When farther on Husserl exclaims: “If all masses subject to attraction were to disappear, the law of attraction would not be destroyed but would simply remain without any possible application,” I know that I am faced with a metaphysic of consolation.  And if I want to discover the point where thought leaves the path of evidence, I have only to reread the parallel reasoning that Husserl voices regarding the mind: “If we could contemplate clearly the exact laws of psychic processes, they would be seen to be likewise eternal and invariable, like the basic laws of theoretical natural science.  Hence they would be valid even if there were no psychic process.” Even if the mind were not, its laws would be! I see then that of a psychological truth Husserl aims to make a rational rule: after having denied the integrating power of human reason, he leaps by this expedient to eternal Reason.  Husserl’s theme of the “concrete universe” cannot then surprise me.  If I am told that all essences are not formal but that some are material, that the first are the object of logic and the second of science, this is merely a question of definition.  The abstract, I am told, indicates but a part, without consistency in itself, of a concrete universal.  But the wavering already noted allows me to throw light on the confusion of these terms.  For that may mean that the concrete object of my attention, this sky, the reflection of that water on this coat, alone preserve the prestige of the real that my interest isolates in the world.  And I shall not deny it.  But that may mean also that this coat itself is universal, has its particular and sufficient essence, belongs to the world of forms.  I then realize that merely the order of the procession has been changed.  This world has ceased to have its reflection in a higher universe, but the heaven of forms is figured in the host of images of this earth.  This changes nothing for me.  Rather than encountering here a taste for the concrete, the meaning of the human condition, I find an intellectualism sufficiently unbridled to generalize the concrete itself.  * * * It is futile to be amazed by the apparent paradox that leads thought to its own negation by the opposite paths of humiliated reason and triumphal reason.  From the abstract god of Husserl to the dazzling god of Kierkegaard the distance is not so great.  Reason and the irrational lead to the same preaching.  In truth the way matters but little; the will to arrive suffices.  The abstract philosopher and the religious philosopher start out from the same disorder and support each other in the same anxiety.  But the essential is to explain.  Nostalgia is stronger here than knowledge.  It is significant that the thought of the epoch is at once one of the most deeply imbued with a philosophy of the non-significance of the world and one of the most divided in its conclusions.  It is constantly oscillating between extreme rationalization of reality which tends to break up that thought into standard reasons and its extreme irrationalization which tends to deify it.  But this divorce is only apparent.  It is a matter of reconciliation, and, in both cases, the leap suffices.  It is always wrongly thought that the notion of reason is a one-way notion.  To tell the truth, however rigorous it may be in its ambition, this concept is nonetheless just as unstable as others.  Reason bears a quite human aspect, but it also is able to turn toward the divine.  Since Plotinus, who was the first to reconcile it with the eternal climate, it has learned to turn away from the most cherished of its principles, which is contradiction, in order to integrate into it the strangest, the quite magic one of participation.  *10 It is an instrument of thought and not thought itself.  Above all, a man’s thought is his nostalgia.  Just as reason was able to soothe the melancholy of Plotinus, it provides modern anguish the means of calming itself in the familiar setting of the eternal.  The absurd mind has less luck.  For it the world is neither so rational nor so irrational.  It is unreasonable and only that.  With Husserl the reason eventually has no limits at all.  The absurd, on the contrary, establishes its limits since it is powerless to calm its anguish.  Kierkegaard independently asserts that a single limit is enough to negate that anguish.  But the absurd does not go so far.  For it that limit is directed solely at the reason’s ambitions.  The theme of the irrational, as it is conceived by the existentials, is reason becoming confused and escaping by negating itself.  The absurd is lucid reason noting its limits.  Only at the end of this difficult path does the absurd man recognize his true motives.  Upon comparing his inner exigence and what is then offered him, he suddenly feels he is going to turn away.  In the universe of Husserl the world becomes clear and that longing for familiarity that man’s heart harbors becomes useless.  In Kierkegaard’s apocalypse that desire for clarity must be given up if it wants to be satisfied.  Sin is not so much knowing (if it were, everybody would be innocent) as wanting to know.  Indeed, it is the only sin of which the absurd man can feel that it constitutes both his guilt and his innocence.  He is offered a solution in which all the past contradictions have become merely polemical games.  But this is not the way he experienced them.  Their truth must be preserved, which consists in not being satisfied.  He does not want preaching.  My reasoning wants to be faithful to the evidence that aroused it.  That evidence is the absurd.  It is that divorce between the mind that desires and the world that disappoints, my nostalgia for unity, this fragmented universe and the contradiction that binds them together.  Kierkegaard suppresses my nostalgia and Husserl gathers together that universe.  That is not what I was expecting.  It was a matter of living and thinking with those dislocations, of knowing whether one had to accept or refuse.  There can be no question of masking the evidence, of suppressing the absurd by denying one of the terms of its equation.  It is essential to know whether one can live with it or whether, on the other hand, logic commands one to die of it.  I am not interested in philosophical suicide, but rather in plain suicide.  I merely wish to purge it of its emotional content and know its logic and its integrity.  Any other position implies for the absurd mind deceit and the mind’s retreat before what the mind itself has brought to light.  Husserl claims to obey the desire to escape “the inveterate habit of living and thinking in certain well-known and convenient conditions of existence,” but the final leap restores in him the eternal and its comfort.  The leap does not represent an extreme danger as Kierkegaard would like it to do.  The danger, on the contrary, lies in the subtle instant that precedes the leap.  Being able to remain on that dizzying crest—that is integrity and the rest is subterfuge.  I know also that never has helplessness inspired such striking harmonies as those of Kierkegaard.  But if helplessness has its place in the indifferent landscapes of history, it has none in a reasoning whose exigence is now known.  Absurd Freedom Now the main thing is done, I hold certain facts from which I cannot separate.  What I know, what is certain, what I cannot deny, what I cannot reject—this is what counts.  I can negate everything of that part of me that lives on vague nostalgias, except this desire for unity, this longing to solve, this need for clarity and cohesion.  I can refute everything in this world surrounding me that offends or enraptures me, except this chaos, this sovereign chance and this divine equivalence which springs from anarchy.  I don’t know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it.  But I know that I do not know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it.  What can a meaning outside my condition mean to me? I can understand only in human terms.  What I touch, what resists me—that is what I understand.  And these two certainties—my appetite for the absolute and for unity and the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle—I also know that I cannot reconcile them.  What other truth can I admit without lying, without bringing in a hope I lack and which means nothing within the limits of my condition? If I were a tree among trees, a cat among animals, this life would have a meaning, or rather this problem would not arise, for I should belong to this world.  I should be this world to which I am now opposed by my whole consciousness and my whole insistence upon familiarity.  This ridiculous reason is what sets me in opposition to all creation.  I cannot cross it out with a stroke of the pen.  What I believe to be true I must therefore preserve.  What seems to me so obvious, even against me, I must support.  And what constitutes the basis of that conflict, of that break between the world and my mind, but the awareness of it? If therefore I want to preserve it, I can through a constant awareness, ever revived, ever alert.  This is what, for the moment, I must remember.  At this moment the absurd, so obvious and yet so hard to win, returns to a man’s life and finds its home there.  At this moment, too, the mind can leave the arid, dried-up path of lucid effort.  That path now emerges in daily life.  It encounters the world of the anonymous impersonal pronoun “one,” but henceforth man enters in with his revolt and his lucidity.  He has forgotten how to hope.  This hell of the present is his Kingdom at last.  All problems recover their sharp edge.  Abstract evidence retreats before the poetry of forms and colors.  Spiritual conflicts become embodied and return to the abject and magnificent shelter of man’s heart.  None of them is settled.  But all are transfigured.  Is one going to die, escape by the leap, rebuild a mansion of ideas and forms to one’s own scale? Is one, on the contrary, going to take up the heart-rending and marvelous wager of the absurd? Let’s make a final effort in this regard and draw all our conclusions.  The body, affection, creation, action, human nobility will then resume their places in this mad world.  At last man will again find there the wine of the absurd and the bread of indifference on which he feeds his greatness.  Let us insist again on the method: it is a matter of persisting.  At a certain point on his path the absurd man is tempted.  History is not lacking in either religions or prophets, even without gods.  He is asked to leap.  All he can reply is that he doesn’t fully understand, that it is not obvious.  Indeed, he does not want to do anything but what he fully understands.  He is assured that this is the sin of pride, but he does not understand the notion of sin; that perhaps hell is in store, but he has not enough imagination to visualize that strange future; that he is losing immortal life, but that seems to him an idle consideration.  An attempt is made to get him to admit his guilt.  He feels innocent.  To tell the truth, that is all he feels—his irreparable innocence.  This is what allows him everything.  Hence, what he demands of himself is to live solely with what he knows, to accommodate himself to what is, and to bring in nothing that is not certain.  He is told that nothing is.  But this at least is a certainty.  And it is with this that he is concerned: he wants to find out if it is possible to live without appeal .  * * * Now I can broach the notion of suicide.  It has already been felt what solution might be given.  At this point the problem is reversed.  It was previously a question of finding out whether or not life had to have a meaning to be lived.  It now becomes clear, on the contrary, that it will be lived all the better if it has no meaning.  Living an experience, a particular fate, is accepting it fully.  Now, no one will live this fate, knowing it to be absurd, unless he does everything to keep before him that absurd brought to light by consciousness.  Negating one of the terms of the opposition on which he lives amounts to escaping it.  To abolish conscious revolt is to elude the problem.  The theme of permanent revolution is thus carried into individual experience.  Living is keeping the absurd alive.  Keeping it alive is, above all, contemplating it.  Unlike Eurydice, the absurd dies only when we turn away from it.  One of the only coherent philosophical positions is thus revolt.  It is a constant confrontation between man and his own obscurity.  It is an insistence upon an impossible transparency.  It challenges the world anew every second.  Just as danger provided man the unique opportunity of seizing awareness, so metaphysical revolt extends awareness to the whole of experience.  It is that constant presence of man in his own eyes.  It is not aspiration, for it is devoid of hope.  That revolt is the certainty of a crushing fate, without the resignation that ought to accompany it.  This is where it is seen to what a degree absurd experience is remote from suicide.  It may be thought that suicide follows revolt—but wrongly.  For it does not represent the logical outcome of revolt.  It is just the contrary by the consent it presupposes.  Suicide, like the leap, is acceptance at its extreme.  Everything is over and man returns to his essential history.  His future, his unique and dreadful future—he sees and rushes toward it.  In its way, suicide settles the absurd.  It engulfs the absurd in the same death.  But I know that in order to keep alive, the absurd cannot be settled.  It escapes suicide to the extent that it is simultaneously awareness and rejection of death.  It is, at the extreme limit of the condemned man’s last thought, that shoelace that despite everything he sees a few yards away, on the very brink of his dizzying fall.  The contrary of suicide, in fact, is the man condemned to death.  That revolt gives life its value.  Spread out over the whole length of a life, it restores its majesty to that life.  To a man devoid of blinders, there is no finer sight than that of the intelligence at grips with a reality that transcends it.  The sight of human pride is unequaled.  No disparagement is of any use.  That discipline that the mind imposes on itself, that will conjured up out of nothing, that face-to-face struggle have something exceptional about them.  To impoverish that reality whose inhumanity constitutes man’s majesty is tantamount to impoverishing him himself.  I understand then why the doctrines that explain everything to me also debilitate me at the same time.  They relieve me of the weight of my own life, and yet I must carry it alone.  At this juncture, I cannot conceive that a skeptical metaphysics can be joined to an ethics of renunciation.  Consciousness and revolt, these rejections are the contrary of renunciation.  Everything that is indomitable and passionate in a human heart quickens them, on the contrary, with its own life.  It is essential to die unreconciled and not of one’s own free will.  Suicide is a repudiation.  The absurd man can only drain everything to the bitter end, and deplete himself.  The absurd is his extreme tension, which he maintains constantly by solitary effort, for he knows that in that consciousness and in that day-to-day revolt he gives proof of his only truth, which is defiance.  This is a first consequence.  * * * If I remain in that prearranged position which consists in drawing all the conclusions (and nothing else) involved in a newly discovered notion, I am faced with a second paradox.  In order to remain faithful to that method, I have nothing to do with the problem of metaphysical liberty.  Knowing whether or not man is free doesn’t interest me.  I can experience only my own freedom.  As to it, I can have no general notions, but merely a few clear insights.  The problem of “freedom as such” has no meaning.  For it is linked in quite a different way with the problem of God.  Knowing whether or not man is free involves knowing whether he can have a master.  The absurdity peculiar to this problem comes from the fact that the very notion that makes the problem of freedom possible also takes away all its meaning.  For in the presence of God there is less a problem of freedom than a problem of evil.  You know the alternative: either we are not free and God the all-powerful is responsible for evil.  Or we are free and responsible but God is not all-powerful.  All the scholastic subtleties have neither added anything to nor subtracted anything from the acuteness of this paradox.  This is why I cannot get lost in the glorification or the mere definition of a notion which eludes me and loses its meaning as soon as it goes beyond the frame of reference of my individual experience.  I cannot understand what kind of freedom would be given me by a higher being.  I have lost the sense of hierarchy.  The only conception of freedom I can have is that of the prisoner or the individual in the midst of the State.  The only one I know is freedom of thought and action.  Now if the absurd cancels all my chances of eternal freedom, it restores and magnifies, on the other hand, my freedom of action.  That privation of hope and future means an increase in man’s availability.  Before encountering the absurd, the everyday man lives with aims, a concern for the future or for justification (with regard to whom or what is not the question).  He weighs his chances, he counts on “someday,” his retirement or the labor of his sons.  He still thinks that something in his life can be directed.  In truth, he acts as if he were free, even if all the facts make a point of contradicting that liberty.  But after the absurd, everything is upset.  That idea that “I am,” my way of acting as if everything has a meaning (even if, on occasion, I said that nothing has)—all that is given the lie in vertiginous fashion by the absurdity of a possible death.  Thinking of the future, establishing aims for oneself, having preferences—all this presupposes a belief in freedom, even if one occasionally ascertains that one doesn’t feel it.  But at that moment I am well aware that that higher liberty, that freedom to be , which alone can serve as basis for a truth, does not exist.  Death is there as the only reality.  After death the chips are down.  I am not even free, either, to perpetuate myself, but a slave, and, above all, a slave without hope of an eternal revolution, without recourse to contempt.  And who without revolution and without contempt can remain a slave? What freedom can exist in the fullest sense without assurance of eternity? But at the same time the absurd man realizes that hitherto he was bound to that postulate of freedom on the illusion of which he was living.  In a certain sense, that hampered him.  To the extent to which he imagined a purpose to his life, he adapted himself to the demands of a purpose to be achieved and became the slave of his liberty.  Thus I could not act otherwise than as the father (or the engineer or the leader of a nation, or the post-office sub-clerk) that I am preparing to be.  I think I can choose to be that rather than something else.  I think so unconsciously, to be sure.  But at the same time I strengthen my postulate with the beliefs of those around me, with the presumptions of my human environment (others are so sure of being free, and that cheerful mood is so contagious!).  However far one may remain from any presumption, moral or social, one is partly influenced by them and even, for the best among them (there are good and bad presumptions), one adapts one’s life to them.  Thus the absurd man realizes that he was not really free.  To speak clearly, to the extent to which I hope, to which I worry about a truth that might be individual to me, about a way of being or creating, to the extent to which I arrange my life and prove thereby that I accept its having a meaning, I create for myself barriers between which I confine my life.  I do like so many bureaucrats of the mind and heart who only fill me with disgust and whose only vice, I now see clearly, is to take man’s freedom seriously.  The absurd enlightens me on this point: there is no future.  Henceforth this is the reason for my inner freedom.  I shall use two comparisons here.  Mystics, to begin with, find freedom in giving themselves.  By losing themselves in their god, by accepting his rules, they become secretly free.  In spontaneously accepted slavery they recover a deeper independence.  But what does that freedom mean? It may be said, above all, that they feel free with regard to themselves, and not so much free as liberated.  Likewise, completely turned toward death (taken here as the most obvious absurdity), the absurd man feels released from everything outside that passionate attention crystallizing in him.  He enjoys a freedom with regard to common rules.  It can be seen at this point that the initial themes of existential philosophy keep their entire value.  The return to consciousness, the escape from everyday sleep represent the first steps of absurd freedom.  But it is existential preaching that is alluded to, and with it that spiritual leap which basically escapes consciousness.  In the same way (this is my second comparison) the slaves of antiquity did not belong to themselves.  But they knew that freedom which consists in not feeling responsible.  *11 Death, too, has patrician hands which, while crushing, also liberate.  Losing oneself in that bottomless certainty, feeling henceforth sufficiently remote from one’s own life to increase it and take a broad view of it—this involves the principle of a liberation.  Such new independence has a definite time limit, like any freedom of action.  It does not write a check on eternity.  But it takes the place of the illusions of freedom , which all stopped with death.  The divine availability of the condemned man before whom the prison doors open in a certain early dawn, that unbelievable disinterestedness with regard to everything except for the pure flame of life—it is clear that death and the absurd are here the principles of the only reasonable freedom: that which a human heart can experience and live.  This is a second consequence.  The absurd man thus catches sight of a burning and frigid, transparent and limited universe in which nothing is possible but everything is given, and beyond which all is collapse and nothingness.  He can then decide to accept such a universe and draw from it his strength, his refusal to hope, and the unyielding evidence of a life without consolation.  * * * But what does life mean in such a universe? Nothing else for the moment but indifference to the future and a desire to use up everything that is given.  Belief in the meaning of life always implies a scale of values, a choice, our preferences.  Belief in the absurd, according to our definitions, teaches the contrary.  But this is worth examining.  Knowing whether or not one can live without appeal is all that interests me.  I do not want to get out of my depth.  This aspect of life being given me, can I adapt myself to it? Now, faced with this particular concern, belief in the absurd is tantamount to substituting the quantity of experiences for the quality.  If I convince myself that this life has no other aspect than that of the absurd, if I feel that its whole equilibrium depends on that perpetual opposition between my conscious revolt and the darkness in which it struggles, if I admit that my freedom has no meaning except in relation to its limited fate, then I must say that what counts is not the best living but the most living.  It is not up to me to wonder if this is vulgar or revolting, elegant or deplorable.  Once and for all, value judgments are discarded here in favor of factual judgments.  I have merely to draw the conclusions from what I can see and to risk nothing that is hypothetical.  Supposing that living in this way were not honorable, then true propriety would command me to be dishonorable.  The most living; in the broadest sense, that rule means nothing.  It calls for definition.  It seems to begin with the fact that the notion of quantity has not been sufficiently explored.  For it can account for a large share of human experience.  A man’s rule of conduct and his scale of values have no meaning except through the quantity and variety of experiences he has been in a position to accumulate.  Now, the conditions of modern life impose on the majority of men the same quantity of experiences and consequently the same profound experience.  To be sure, there must also be taken into consideration the individual’s spontaneous contribution, the “given” element in him.  But I cannot judge of that, and let me repeat that my rule here is to get along with the immediate evidence.  I see, then, that the individual character of a common code of ethics lies not so much in the ideal importance of its basic principles as in the norm of an experience that it is possible to measure.  To stretch a point somewhat, the Greeks had the code of their leisure just as we have the code of our eight-hour day.  But already many men among the most tragic cause us to foresee that a longer experience changes this table of values.  They make us imagine that adventurer of the everyday who through mere quantity of experiences would break all records (I am purposely using this sports expression) and would thus win his own code of ethics.  *12 Yet let’s avoid romanticism and just ask ourselves what such an attitude may mean to a man with his mind made up to take up his bet and to observe strictly what he takes to be the rules of the game.  Breaking all the records is first and foremost being faced with the world as often as possible.  How can that be done without contradictions and without playing on words? For on the one hand the absurd teaches that all experiences are unimportant, and on the other it urges toward the greatest quantity of experiences.  How, then, can one fail to do as so many of those men I was speaking of earlier—choose the form of life that brings us the most possible of that human matter, thereby introducing a scale of values that on the other hand one claims to reject? But again it is the absurd and its contradictory life that teaches us.  For the mistake is thinking that that quantity of experiences depends on the circumstances of our life when it depends solely on us.  Here we have to be over-simple.  To two men living the same number of years, the world always provides the same sum of experiences.  It is up to us to be conscious of them.  Being aware of one’s life, one’s revolt, one’s freedom, and to the maximum, is living, and to the maximum.  Where lucidity dominates, the scale of values becomes useless.  Let’s be even more simple.  Let us say that the sole obstacle, the sole deficiency to be made good, is constituted by premature death.  Thus it is that no depth, no emotion, no passion, and no sacrifice could render equal in the eyes of the absurd man (even if he wished it so) a conscious life of forty years and a lucidity spread over sixty years.  *13 Madness and death are his irreparables.  Man does not choose.  The absurd and the extra life it involves therefore do not depend on man’s will , but on its contrary, which is death.  *14 Weighing words carefully, it is altogether a question of luck.  One just has to be able to consent to this.  There will never be any substitute for twenty years of life and experience.  By what is an odd inconsistency in such an alert race, the Greeks claimed that those who died young were beloved of the gods.  And that is true only if you are willing to believe that entering the ridiculous world of the gods is forever losing the purest of joys, which is feeling, and feeling on this earth.  The present and the succession of presents before a constantly conscious soul is the ideal of the absurd man.  But the word “ideal” rings false in this connection.  It is not even his vocation, but merely the third consequence of his reasoning.  Having started from an anguished awareness of the inhuman, the meditation on the absurd returns at the end of its itinerary to the very heart of the passionate flames of human revolt.  *15 * * * Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion.  By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death—and I refuse suicide.  I know, to be sure, the dull resonance that vibrates throughout these days.  Yet I have but a word to say: that it is necessary.  When Nietzsche writes: “It clearly seems that the chief thing in heaven and on earth is to obey at length and in a single direction: in the long run there results something for which it is worth the trouble of living on this earth as, for example, virtue, art, music, the dance, reason, the mind—something that transfigures, something delicate, mad, or divine,” he elucidates the rule of a really distinguished code of ethics.  But he also points the way of the absurd man.  Obeying the flame is both the easiest and the hardest thing to do.  However, it is good for man to judge himself occasionally.  He is alone in being able to do so.  “Prayer,” says Alain, “is when night descends over thought.” “But the mind must meet the night,” reply the mystics and the existentials.  Yes, indeed, but not that night that is born under closed eyelids and through the mere will of man—dark, impenetrable night that the mind calls up in order to plunge into it.  If it must encounter a night, let it be rather that of despair, which remains lucid—polar night, vigil of the mind, whence will arise perhaps that white and virginal brightness which outlines every object in the light of the intelligence.  At that degree, equivalence encounters passionate understanding.  Then it is no longer even a question of judging the existential leap.  It resumes its place amid the age-old fresco of human attitudes.  For the spectator, if he is conscious, that leap is still absurd.  In so far as it thinks it solves the paradox, it reinstates it intact.  On this score, it is stirring.  On this score, everything resumes its place and the absurd world is reborn in all its splendor and diversity.  But it is bad to stop, hard to be satisfied with a single way of seeing, to go without contradiction, perhaps the most subtle of all spiritual forces.  The preceding merely defines a way of thinking.  But the point is to live.  *1 From the point of view of the relative value of truth.  On the other hand, from the point of view of virile behavior, this scholar’s fragility may well make us smile.  *2 Let us not miss this opportunity to point out the relative character of this essay.  Suicide may indeed be related to much more honorable considerations—for example, the political suicides of protest, as they were called, during the Chinese revolution.  *3 I have heard of an emulator of Peregrinos, a post-war writer who, after having finished his first book, committed suicide to attract attention to his work.  Attention was in fact attracted, but the book was judged no good.  *4 But not in the proper sense.  This is not a definition, but rather an enumeration of the feelings that may admit of the absurd.  Still, the enumeration finished, the absurd has nevertheless not been exhausted.  *5 Apropos of the notion of exception particularly and against Aristotle.  *6 It may be thought that I am neglecting here the essential problem, that of faith.  But I am not examining the philosophy of Kierkegaard or of Chestov or, later on, of Husserl (this would call for a different place and a different attitude of mind); I am simply borrowing a theme from them and examining whether its consequences can fit the already established rules.  It is merely a matter of persistence.  *7 I did not say “excludes God,” which would still amount to asserting.  *8 Let me assert again: it is not the affirmation of God that is questioned here, but rather the logic leading to that affirmation.  *9 Even the most rigorous epistemologies imply metaphysics.  And to such a degree that the metaphysic of many contemporary thinkers consists in having nothing but an epistemology.  *10 A.—At that time reason had to adapt itself or die.  It adapts itself.  With Plotinus, after being logical it becomes æsthetic.  Metaphor takes the place of the syllogism.  B.—Moreover, this is not Plotinus’ only contribution to phenomenology.  This whole attitude is already contained in the concept so dear to the Alexandrian thinker that there is not only an idea of man but also an idea of Socrates.  *11 I am concerned here with a factual comparison, not with an apology of humility.  The absurd man is the contrary of the reconciled man.  *12 Quantity sometimes constitutes quality.  If I can believe the latest restatements of scientific theory, all matter is constituted by centers of energy.  Their greater or lesser quantity makes its specificity more or less remarkable.  A billion ions and one ion differ not only in quantity but also in quality.  It is easy to find an analogy in human experience.  *13 Same reflection on a notion as different as the idea of eternal nothingness.  It neither adds anything to nor subtracts anything from reality.  In psychological experience of nothingness, it is by the consideration of what will happen in two thousand years that our own nothingness truly takes on meaning.  In one of its aspects, eternal nothingness is made up precisely of the sum of lives to come which will not be ours.  *14 The will is only the agent here: it tends to maintain consciousness.  It provides a discipline of life, and that is appreciable.  *15 What matters is coherence.  We start out here from acceptance of the world.  But Oriental thought teaches that one can indulge in the same effort of logic by choosing against the world.  That is just as legitimate and gives this essay its perspectives and its limits.  But when the negation of the world is pursued just as rigorously, one often achieves (in certain Vedantic schools) similar results regarding, for instance, the indifference of works.  In a book of great importance, Le Choix , Jean Grenier establishes in this way a veritable “philosophy of indifference.” Continued, The Myth of Sisyphus O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible .  —Pindar, Pythian iii THE PAGES that follow deal with an absurd sensitivity that can be found widespread in the age—and not with an absurd philosophy which our time, properly speaking, has not known.  It is therefore simply fair to point out, at the outset, what these pages owe to certain contemporary thinkers.  It is so far from my intention to hide this that they will be found cited and commented upon throughout this work.  But it is useful to note at the same time that the absurd, hitherto taken as a conclusion, is considered in this essay as a starting-point.  In this sense it may be said that there is something provisional in my commentary: one cannot prejudge the position it entails.  There will be found here merely the description, in the pure state, of an intellectual malady.  No metaphysic, no belief is involved in it for the moment.  These are the limits and the only bias of this book.  Certain personal experiences urge me to make this clear.  Fear and Trembling Problemata Fear and Trembling Preface Not just in commerce but in the world of ideas too our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale.  Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.  Every speculative score-keeper who conscientiously marks up the momentous march of modem philosophy, every lecturer, crammer, student, everyone on the outskirts of philosophy or at its centre is unwilling to stop with doubting everything.  They all go further.  It would perhaps be malapropos to inquire where they think they are going, though surely we may in all politeness and respect take it for granted that they have indeed doubted everything, otherwise it would be odd to talk of going further.  This preliminary step is one they have all of them taken, and presumably with so little effort as to feel no need to drop some word about how; for not even someone genuinely anxious for a little enlightenment on this will find such.  Not a gesture that might point him in the right direction, no small dietary prescription for how to go about such a huge task.  ‘But Descartes did it, didn’t he?’ A venerable, humble, honest thinker whose writings surely no one can read without being most deeply stirred - Descartes must have done what he has said and said what he has done.  A rare enough occurrence in our own time! Descartes, as he himself repeatedly insists, was no doubter in matters of faith.  (‘But we must keep in mind what has been said, that we must trust to this natural light only so long as nothing contrary to it is revealed by God himself ...  Above all we should impress on our memory as an infallible rule that what God has revealed to us is incomparably more certain than anything else; and that we ought to submit to the Divine authority rather than to our own judgement even though the light of reason may seem to us to suggest, with the utmost clearness and evidence, something opposite’ from Principles 28 and 76 of Principles of Philosophy.) Descartes has not cried ‘Fire!’ and made it everyone’s duty to doubt, for Descartes was a quiet and lonely thinker, not a bellowing streetwatch; he was modest enough to allow that his method was important only for himself and sprang partly from his own earlier bungling with knowledge.  (‘Thus my design here is not to teach the Method which everyone should follow in order to promote the good conduct of Reason, but only to show in what manner I have endeavoured to conduct my own ...  But so soon as I had achieved the entire course of study that is, of his youth - Johannes de silentio’s interpolation at the close of which one is usually received into the ranks of the learned, I entirely changed my opinion.  For I found myself embarrassed with so many doubts and errors that it seemed to me that the effort to instruct myself had no effect other than the increasing discovery of my own ignorance’ Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason and Seeking the Truth in the Sciences .) - What those old Greeks, whom one must also credit with a little knowledge of philosophy, took to be the task of a whole lifetime, doubt not being a skill one acquires in days and weeks; what the old veteran warrior achieved after keeping the balance of doubt in the face of all inveiglements, fearlessly rejecting the certainties of sense and thought, incorruptibly defying selfish anxieties and the wheedling of sympathies - that is where nowadays everyone begins.  Today nobody will stop with faith; they all go further.  It would perhaps be rash to inquire where to, but surely a mark of urbanity and good breeding on my part to assume that in fact everyone does indeed have faith, otherwise it would be odd to talk of going further.  In those old days it was different.  For then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, not a skill thought to be acquired in either days or weeks.  When the old campaigner approached the end, had fought the good fight, and kept his faith, his heart was still young enough not to have forgotten the fear and trembling that disciplined his youth and which, although the grown man mastered it, no man altogether outgrows - unless he somehow manages at the earliest possible opportunity to go further.  Where these venerable figures arrived our own age begins, in order to go further.  The present author is no philosopher, he has not understood the System, nor does he know if there really is one, or if it has been completed.  As far as his own weak head is concerned the thought of what huge heads everyone must have in order to have such huge thoughts is already enough.  Even if one were able to render the whole of the content of faith into conceptual form, it would not follow that one had grasped faith, grasped how one came to it, or how it came to one.  The present author is no philosopher, he is poetice et eleganter to put it in poetic and well-chosen terms, an occasional copyist who neither writes the System nor makes any promises about it, who pledges neither anything about the System nor himself to it.  He writes because for him doing so is a luxury, the more agreeable and conspicuous the fewer who buy and read what he writes.  In an age where passion has been done away with for the sake of science he easily foresees his fate - in an age when an author who wants readers must be careful to write in a way that he can be comfortably leafed through during the after-dinner nap, and be sure to present himself to the world like the polite gardener’s boy in the Advertiser who, hat in hand and with good references from his previous place of employment, recommends himself to a much-esteemed public.  He foresees his fate will be to be completely ignored; has a dreadful foreboding that the scourge of zealous criticism will more than once make itself felt; and shudders at what terrifies him even more, that some enterprising recorder, a paragraph swallower who to rescue learning is always willing to do to others’ writings what, to ‘preserve good taste’, Trop nobly did to The Destruction of the Human Race, will slice him into sections as ruthlessly as the man who, in the service of the science of punctuation, divided up his speech by counting the words and putting a full-stop after every fifty and a semi-colon after every thirty-five.  No, I prostrate myself before any systematic bag-searcher; this is not the System, it hasn’t the slightest thing to do with the System.  I wish all good on the System and on the Danish shareholders in that omnibus; for it will hardly become a tower.  I wish them good luck and prosperity one and all.  Respectfully Johannes de silentio Fear and Trembling Attunement There was once a man; he had learned as a child that beautiful tale of how God tried Abraham, how he withstood the test, kept his faith and for the second time received a son against every expectation.  When he became older he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had divided what had been united in the child’s pious simplicity.  The older he became the more often his thoughts turned to that tale, his enthusiasm became stronger and stronger, and yet less and less could he understand it.  Finally it put everything else out of his mind; his soul had but one wish, actually to see Abraham, and one longing, to have been witness to those events.  It was not the beautiful regions of the East, nor the earthly splendour of the Promised Land, he longed to see, not the God-fearing couple whose old age God had blessed, not the venerable figure of the patriarch stricken in years, not the youthful vigour God gave to Isaac - it would have been the same if it had taken place on a barren heath.  What he yearned for was to accompany them on the three-day journey, when Abraham rode with grief before him and Isaac by his side.  He wanted to be there at that moment when Abraham raised his eyes and saw in the distance the mountain in Moriah, the moment he left the asses behind and went on up the mountain alone with Isaac.  For what occupied him was not the finely wrought fabric of imagination, but the shudder of thought.  This man was no thinker, he felt no need to go further than faith.  To be remembered as its father seemed to him to be surely the greatest glory of all, and to have it a lot to be envied even if no one else knew.  This man was no learned exegete, he knew no Hebrew; had he known Hebrew then perhaps it might have been easy for him to understand the story of Abraham.  I And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him ...  Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.  It was early morning.  Abraham rose in good time, had the asses saddled and left his tent, taking Isaac with him, but Sarah watched them from the window as they went down the valley until she could see them no more.  They rode in silence for three days; on the morning of the fourth Abraham still said not a word, but raised his eyes and saw afar the mountain in Moriah.  He left the servants behind and went on alone up the mountain with Isaac beside him.  But Abraham said to himself: ‘I won’t conceal from Isaac where this way is leading him.’ He stood still, laid his hand on Isaac’s head to give him his blessing, and Isaac bent down to receive it.  And Abraham’s expression was fatherly, his gaze gentle, his speech encouraging.  But Isaac could not understand him, his soul could not be uplifted; he clung to Abraham’s knees, pleaded at his feet, begged for his young life, for his fair promise; he called to mind the joy in Abraham’s house, reminded him of the sorrow and loneliness.  Then Abraham lifted the boy up and walked with him, taking him by the hand, and his words were full of comfort and exhortation.  But Isaac could not understand him.  Abraham climbed the mountain in Moriah, but Isaac did not understand him.  Then he turned away from Isaac for a moment, but when Isaac saw his face a second time it was changed, his gaze was wild, his mien one of horror.  He caught Isaac by the chest, threw him to the ground and said: ‘Foolish boy, do you believe I am your father? I am an idolater.  Do you believe this is God’s command? No, it is my own desire.’ Then Isaac trembled and in his anguish cried: ‘God in heaven have mercy on me, God of Abraham have mercy on me; if I have no father on earth, then be Thou my father!’ But below his breath Abraham said to himself: ‘Lord in heaven I thank Thee; it is after all better that he believe I am a monster than that he lose faith in Thee.’ When the child is to be weaned the mother blackens her breast, for it would be a shame were the breast to look pleasing when the child is not to have it.  So the child believes that the breast has changed but the mother is the same, her look loving and tender as ever.  Lucky the one that needed no more terrible means to wean the child! II It was early morning.  Abraham rose in good time, embraced Sarah, the bride of his old age, and Sarah kissed Isaac, who had taken her disgrace from her, was her pride and hope for all generations.  So they rode on in silence and Abraham’s eyes were fixed on the ground, until the fourth day when he looked up and saw afar the mountain in Moriah, but he turned his gaze once again to the ground.  Silently he arranged the fire-wood, bound Isaac; silently he drew the knife.  Then he saw the ram that God had appointed.  He sacrificed that and returned home ...  From that day on, Abraham became old, he could not forget that God had demanded this of him.  Isaac throve as before; but Abraham’s eye was darkened, he saw joy no more.  When the child has grown and is to be weaned the mother virginally covers her breast, so the child no more has a mother.  Lucky the child that lost its mother in no other way! III It was early morning.  Abraham rose in good time, kissed Sarah the young mother, and Sarah kissed Isaac, her delight, her joy for ever.  And Abraham rode thoughtfully on.  He thought of Hagar and of the son whom he had driven out into the desert.  He climbed the mountain in Moriah, he drew the knife.  It was a tranquil evening when Abraham rode out alone, and he rode to the mountain in Moriah: he threw himself on his face, he begged God to forgive his sin at having been willing to sacrifice Isaac, at the father’s having forgotten his duty to his son.  He rode more frequently on his lonely way, but found no peace.  He could not comprehend that it was a sin to have been willing to sacrifice to God the best he owned; that for which he would many a time have gladly laid down his own life; and if it was a sin, if he had not so loved Isaac, then he could not understand that it could be forgiven; for what sin was more terrible? When the child is to be weaned the mother too is not without sorrow, that she and the child grow more and more apart; that the child which first lay beneath her heart, yet later rested at her breast, should no longer be so close.  Thus together they suffer this brief sorrow.  Lucky the one who kept the child so close and had no need to sorrow more! IV It was early morning.  Everything had been made ready for the journey in Abraham’s house.  Abraham took leave of Sarah, and the faithful servant Eleazar followed him out on the way until he had to turn back.  They rode together in accord, Abraham and Isaac, until they came to the mountain in Moriah.  Yet Abraham made everything ready for the sacrifice, calmly and quietly, but as he turned away Isaac saw that Abraham’s left hand was clenched in anguish, that a shudder went through his body - but Abraham drew the knife.  Then they turned home again and Sarah ran to meet them, but Isaac had lost his faith.  Never a word in the whole world is spoken of this, and Isaac told no one what he had seen, and Abraham never suspected that anyone had seen it.  When the child is to be weaned the mother has more solid food at hand, so that the child will not perish.  Lucky the one who has more solid food at hand! In these and similar ways this man of whom we speak thought about those events.  Every time he came home from a journey to the mountain in Moriah he collapsed in weariness, clasped his hands, and said: ‘Yet no one was as great as Abraham; who is able to understand him?’ Fear and Trembling Fear and Trembling What Tarquin the Proud said in his garden with the poppy blooms was understood by the son but not by the messenger.  HAMANN Fear and Trembling Epilogue Once when the spice market in Holland was a little slack, the merchants had some cargoes dumped at sea to force up the price.  That was a pardonable, perhaps necessary, stratagem.  Is it something similar we need in the world of spirit? Are we so convinced of having reached the heights that there is nothing left but piously to believe we still haven’t come that far, so as at least to have something to fill the time with? Is it this kind of trick of self-deception the present generation needs, is it to a virtuosity in this it should be educated, or has it not already perfected itself sufficiently in the art of self-deception? Or is what it needs not rather an honest seriousness which fearlessly and incorruptibly calls attention to the tasks, an honest seriousness that lovingly fences the tasks about, which does not frighten people into wanting to dash precipitately to the heights, but keeps the tasks young and beautiful and charming to behold, and inviting to all, yet hard too and an inspiration to noble minds, since noble natures are only inspired by difficulty? However much one generation learns from another, it can never learn from its predecessor the genuinely human factor.  In this respect every generation begins afresh, has no task other than that of any previous generation, and comes no further, provided the latter hasn’t shirked its task and deceived itself.  This authentically human factor is passion, in which the one generation also fully understands the other and understands itself.  Thus no generation has learned from another how to love, no generation can begin other than at the beginning, the task of no later generation is shorter than its predecessor’s, and if someone, unlike the previous generation, is unwilling to stay with love but wants to go further, then that is simply idle and foolish talk.  But the highest passion in a human being is faith, and here no generation begins other than where its predecessor did, every generation begins from the beginning, the succeeding generation comes no further than the previous one, provided the latter was true to its task and didn’t betray it.  That this sounds wearying is not of course for the generation to say, for it is indeed the generation that has the task and it has nothing to do with the fact that the previous generation had the same task, unless that particular generation or the individuals in it presumed to occupy the position to which only the spirit that governs the world, and which has the endurance not to grow weary, is entitled.  If that is the kind of thing the generation begins to do, it is perverted, and what wonder then if the whole of existence should look perverted to it? For surely no one has found life more perverted than the tailor in the fairy-tale who got to heaven in his lifetime and from there looked down on the world.  So long as the generation only worries about its task, which is the highest it can attain to, it cannot grow weary.  That task is always enough for a human lifetime.  When children on holiday get through all their games by noon and then ask impatiently, ‘Can’t anyone think of a new game?’, does this show that they are more developed and advanced than children of the same or a previous generation who could make the games they already know last the whole day? Or does it not rather show that those children lack what I would call the good-natured seriousness that belongs to play? Faith is the highest passion in a human being.  Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.  Whether there are also many who do not discover it in our own age I leave open.  I can only refer to my own experience, that of one who makes no secret of the fact that he has far to go, yet without therefore wishing to deceive either himself or what is great by reducing this latter to a triviality, to a children’s disease which one must hope to get over as soon as possible.  But life has tasks enough, even for one who fails to come as far as faith, and when he loves these honestly life won’t be a waste either, even if it can never compare with that of those who had a sense of the highest and grasped it.  But anyone who comes to faith (whether he be greatly talented or simple-minded makes no difference) won’t remain at a standstill there.  Indeed he would be shocked if anyone said this to him.  Just as the lover would be indignant if someone said he had come to a standstill in his love, for he would reply, ‘I’m by no means standing still in my love, for I have my life in it.’ And yet he too doesn’t come any further, not to anything else.  For when he finds that out he has another explanation.  ‘One must go further, one must go further.’ This need to go on is of ancient standing.  Heraclitus the ‘obscure’ who reposited his thoughts in his writings and his writings in the Temple of Diana (for his thoughts had been his armour in life, which he therefore hung up in the temple of the goddess), the obscure Heraclitus has said, ‘One can never walk through the same river twice.‘ 16 The obscure Heraclitus had a disciple who didn’t remain standing there but went further and added, ‘One cannot do it even once.’† Poor Heraclitus to have such a disciple! This improvement changed the Heraclitian principle into an Eleatic doctrine denying movement, and yet all that disciple wanted was to be a disciple of Heraclitus who went further, not back to what Heraclitus had abandoned.  Absurd Creation, The Myth of Sisyphus ABSURD CREATION Philosophy and Fiction A LL THOSE lives maintained in the rarefied air of the absurd could not persevere without some profound and constant thought to infuse its strength into them.  Right here, it can be only a strange feeling of fidelity.  Conscious men have been seen to fulfill their task amid the most stupid of wars without considering themselves in contradiction.  This is because it was essential to elude nothing.  There is thus a metaphysical honor in enduring the world’s absurdity.  Conquest or play-acting, multiple loves, absurd revolt are tributes that man pays to his dignity in a campaign in which he is defeated in advance.  It is merely a matter of being faithful to the rule of the battle.  That thought may suffice to sustain a mind; it has supported and still supports whole civilizations.  War cannot be negated.  One must live it or die of it.  So it is with the absurd: it is a question of breathing with it, of recognizing its lessons and recovering their flesh.  In this regard the absurd joy par excellence is creation.  “Art and nothing but art,” said Nietzsche; “we have art in order not to die of the truth.” In the experience that I am attempting to describe and to stress on several modes, it is certain that a new torment arises wherever another dies.  The childish chasing after forgetfulness, the appeal of satisfaction are now devoid of echo.  But the constant tension that keeps man face to face with the world, the ordered delirium that urges him to be receptive to everything leave him another fever.  In this universe the work of art is then the sole chance of keeping his consciousness and of fixing its adventures.  Creating is living doubly.  The groping, anxious quest of a Proust, his meticulous collecting of flowers, of wallpapers, and of anxieties, signifies nothing else.  At the same time, it has no more significance than the continual and imperceptible creation in which the actor, the conqueror, and all absurd men indulge every day of their lives.  All try their hands at miming, at repeating, and at re-creating the reality that is theirs.  We always end up by having the appearance of our truths.  All existence for a man turned away from the eternal is but a vast mime under the mask of the absurd.  Creation is the great mime.  Such men know to begin with, and then their whole effort is to examine, to enlarge, and to enrich the ephemeral island on which they have just landed.  But first they must know.  For the absurd discovery coincides with a pause in which future passions are prepared and justified.  Even men without a gospel have their Mount of Olives.  And one must not fall asleep on theirs either.  For the absurd man it is not a matter of explaining and solving, but of experiencing and describing.  Everything begins with lucid indifference.  Describing—that is the last ambition of an absurd thought.  Science likewise, having reached the end of its paradoxes, ceases to propound and stops to contemplate and sketch the ever virgin landscape of phenomena.  The heart learns thus that the emotion delighting us when we see the world’s aspects comes to us not from its depth but from their diversity.  Explanation is useless, but the sensation remains and, with it, the constant attractions of a universe inexhaustible in quantity.  The place of the work of art can be understood at this point.  It marks both the death of an experience and its multiplication.  It is a sort of monotonous and passionate repetition of the themes already orchestrated by the world: the body, inexhaustible image on the pediment of temples, forms or colors, number or grief.  It is therefore not indifferent, as a conclusion, to encounter once again the principal themes of this essay in the wonderful and childish world of the creator.  It would be wrong to see a symbol in it and to think that the work of art can be considered at last as a refuge for the absurd.  It is itself an absurd phenomenon, and we are concerned merely with its description.  It does not offer an escape for the intellectual ailment.  Rather, it is one of the symptoms of that ailment which reflects it throughout a man’s whole thought.  But for the first time it makes the mind get outside of itself and places it in opposition to others, not for it to get lost but to show it clearly the blind path that all have entered upon.  In the time of the absurd reasoning, creation follows indifference and discovery.  It marks the point from which absurd passions spring and where the reasoning stops.  Its place in this essay is justified in this way.  It will suffice to bring to light a few themes common to the creator and the thinker in order to find in the work of art all the contradictions of thought involved in the absurd.  Indeed, it is not so much identical conclusions that prove minds to be related as the contradictions that are common to them.  So it is with thought and creation.  I hardly need to say that the same anguish urges man to these two attitudes.  This is where they coincide in the beginning.  But among all the thoughts that start from the absurd, I have seen that very few remain within it.  And through their deviations or infidelities I have best been able to measure what belonged to the absurd.  Similarly I must wonder: is an absurd work of art possible? * * * It would be impossible to insist too much on the arbitrary nature of the former opposition between art and philosophy.  If you insist on taking it in too limited a sense, it is certainly false.  If you mean merely that these two disciplines each have their peculiar climate, that is probably true but remains vague.  The only acceptable argument used to lie in the contradiction brought up between the philosopher enclosed within his system and the artist placed before his work.  But this was pertinent for a certain form of art and of philosophy which we consider secondary here.  The idea of an art detached from its creator is not only outmoded; it is false.  In opposition to the artist, it is pointed out that no philosopher ever created several systems.  But that is true in so far, indeed, as no artist ever expressed more than one thing under different aspects.  The instantaneous perfection of art, the necessity for its renewal—this is true only through a preconceived notion.  For the work of art likewise is a construction and everyone knows how monotonous the great creators can be.  For the same reason as the thinker, the artist commits himself and becomes himself in his work.  That osmosis raises the most important of æsthetic problems.  Moreover, to anyone who is convinced of the mind’s singleness of purpose, nothing is more futile than these distinctions based on methods and objects.  There are no frontiers between the disciplines that man sets himself for understanding and loving.  They interlock, and the same anxiety merges them.  It is necessary to state this to begin with.  For an absurd work of art to be possible, thought in its most lucid form must be involved in it.  But at the same time thought must not be apparent except as the regulating intelligence.  This paradox can be explained according to the absurd.  The work of art is born of the intelligence’s refusal to reason the concrete.  It marks the triumph of the carnal.  It is lucid thought that provokes it, but in that very act that thought repudiates itself.  It will not yield to the temptation of adding to what is described a deeper meaning that it knows to be illegitimate.  The work of art embodies a drama of the intelligence, but it proves this only indirectly.  The absurd work requires an artist conscious of these limitations and an art in which the concrete signifies nothing more than itself.  It cannot be the end, the meaning, and the consolation of a life.  Creating or not creating changes nothing.  The absurd creator does not prize his work.  He could repudiate it.  He does sometimes repudiate it.  An Abyssinia suffices for this, as in the case of Rimbaud.  At the same time a rule of æsthetics can be seen in this.  The true work of art is always on the human scale.  It is essentially the one that says “less.” There is a certain relationship between the global experience of the artist and the work that reflects that experience, between Wilhelm Meister and Goethe’s maturity.  That relationship is bad when the work aims to give the whole experience in the lace-paper of an explanatory literature.  That relationship is good when the work is but a piece cut out of experience, a facet of the diamond in which the inner luster is epitomized without being limited.  In the first case there is overloading and pretension to the eternal.  In the second, a fecund work because of a whole implied experience, the wealth of which is suspected.  The problem for the absurd artist is to acquire this savoir-vivre which transcends savoir-faire .  And in the end, the great artist under this climate is, above all, a great living being, it being understood that living in this case is just as much experiencing as reflecting.  The work then embodies an intellectual drama.  The absurd work illustrates thought’s renouncing of its prestige and its resignation to being no more than the intelligence that works up appearances and covers with images what has no reason.  If the world were clear, art would not exist.  I am not speaking here of the arts of form or color in which description alone prevails in its splendid modesty.  *1 Expression begins where thought ends.  Those adolescents with empty eyesockets who people temples and museums—their philosophy has been expressed in gestures.  For an absurd man it is more educative than all libraries.  Under another aspect the same is true for music.  If any art is devoid of lessons, it is certainly music.  It is too closely related to mathematics not to have borrowed their gratuitousness.  That game the mind plays with itself according to set and measured laws takes place in the sonorous compass that belongs to us and beyond which the vibrations nevertheless meet in an inhuman universe.  There is no purer sensation.  These examples are too easy.  The absurd man recognizes as his own these harmonies and these forms.  But I should like to speak here of a work in which the temptation to explain remains greatest, in which illusion offers itself automatically, in which conclusion is almost inevitable.  I mean fictional creation.  I propose to inquire whether or not the absurd can hold its own there.  * * * To think is first of all to create a world (or to limit one’s own world, which comes to the same thing).  It is starting out from the basic disagreement that separates man from his experience in order to find a common ground according to one’s nostalgia, a universe hedged with reasons or lighted up with analogies but which, in any case, gives an opportunity to rescind the unbearable divorce.  The philosopher, even if he is Kant, is a creator.  He has his characters, his symbols, and his secret action.  He has his plot endings.  On the contrary, the lead taken by the novel over poetry and the essay merely represents, despite appearances, a greater intellectualization of the art.  Let there be no mistake about it; I am speaking of the greatest.  The fecundity and the importance of a literary form are often measured by the trash it contains.  The number of bad novels must not make us forget the value of the best.  These, indeed, carry with them their universe.  The novel has its logic, its reasonings, its intuition, and its postulates.  It also has its requirements of clarity.  *2 The classical opposition of which I was speaking above is even less justified in this particular case.  It held in the time when it was easy to separate philosophy from its authors.  Today when thought has ceased to lay claim to the universal, when its best history would be that of its repentances, we know that the system, when it is worth while, cannot be separated from its author.  The Ethics itself, in one of its aspects, is but a long and reasoned personal confession.  Abstract thought at last returns to its prop of flesh.  And, likewise, the fictional activities of the body and of the passions are regulated a little more according to the requirements of a vision of the world.  The writer has given up telling “stories” and creates his universe.  The great novelists are philosophical novelists—that is, the contrary of thesis-writers.  For instance, Balzac, Sade, Melville, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Proust, Malraux, Kafka, to cite but a few.  But in fact the preference they have shown for writing in images rather than in reasoned arguments is revelatory of a certain thought that is common to them all, convinced of the uselessness of any principle of explanation and sure of the educative message of perceptible appearance.  They consider the work of art both as an end and a beginning.  It is the outcome of an often unexpressed philosophy, its illustration and its consummation.  But it is complete only through the implications of that philosophy.  It justifies at last that variant of an old theme that a little thought estranges from life whereas much thought reconciles to life.  Incapable of refining the real, thought pauses to mimic it.  The novel in question is the instrument of that simultaneously relative and inexhaustible knowledge, so like that of love.  Of love, fictional creation has the initial wonder and the fecund rumination.  * * * These at least are the charms I see in it at the outset.  But I saw them likewise in those princes of humiliated thought whose suicides I was later able to witness.  What interests me, indeed, is knowing and describing the force that leads them back toward the common path of illusion.  The same method will consequently help me here.  The fact of having already utilized it will allow me to shorten my argument and to sum it up without delay in a particular example.  I want to know whether, accepting a life without appeal , one can also agree to work and create without appeal and what is the way leading to these liberties.  I want to liberate my universe of its phantoms and to people it solely with flesh-and-blood truths whose presence I cannot deny.  I can perform absurd work, choose the creative attitude rather than another.  But an absurd attitude, if it is to remain so, must remain aware of its gratuitousness.  So it is with the work of art.  If the commandments of the absurd are not respected, if the work does not illustrate divorce and revolt, if it sacrifices to illusions and arouses hope, it ceases to be gratuitous.  I can no longer detach myself from it.  My life may find a meaning in it, but that is trifling.  It ceases to be that exercise in detachment and passion which crowns the splendor and futility of a man’s life.  In the creation in which the temptation to explain is the strongest, can one overcome that temptation? In the fictional world in which awareness of the real world is keenest, can I remain faithful to the absurd without sacrificing to the desire to judge? So many questions to be taken into consideration in a last effort.  It must be already clear what they signify.  They are the last scruples of an awareness that fears to forsake its initial and difficult lesson in favor of a final illusion.  What holds for creation, looked upon as one of the possible attitudes for the man conscious of the absurd, holds for all the styles of life open to him.  The conqueror or the actor, the creator or Don Juan may forget that their exercise in living could not do without awareness of its mad character.  One becomes accustomed so quickly.  A man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that money.  Happiness is forgotten; the means are taken for the end.  Likewise, the whole effort of this conqueror will be diverted to ambition, which was but a way toward a greater life.  Don Juan in turn will likewise yield to his fate, be satisfied with that existence whose nobility is of value only through revolt.  For one it is awareness and for the other, revolt; in both cases the absurd has disappeared.  There is so much stubborn hope in the human heart.  The most destitute men often end up by accepting illusion.  That approval prompted by the need for peace inwardly parallels the existential consent.  There are thus gods of light and idols of mud.  But it is essential to find the middle path leading to the faces of man.  So far, the failures of the absurd exigence have best informed us as to what it is.  In the same way, if we are to be informed, it will suffice to notice that fictional creation can present the same ambiguity as certain philosophies.  Hence I can choose as illustration a work comprising everything that denotes awareness of the absurd, having a clear starting-point and a lucid climate.  Its consequences will enlighten us.  If the absurd is not respected in it, we shall know by what expedient illusion enters in.  A particular example, a theme, a creator’s fidelity will suffice, then.  This involves the same analysis that has already been made at greater length.  I shall examine a favorite theme of Dostoevsky.  I might just as well have studied other works.  *3 But in this work the problem is treated directly, in the sense of nobility and emotion, as for the existential philosophies already discussed.  This parallelism serves my purpose.  Kirilov All of Dostoevsky’s heroes question themselves as to the meaning of life.  In this they are modern: they do not fear ridicule.  What distinguishes modern sensibility from classical sensibility is that the latter thrives on moral problems and the former on metaphysical problems.  In Dostoevsky’s novels the question is propounded with such intensity that it can only invite extreme solutions.  Existence is illusory or it is eternal.  If Dostoevsky were satisfied with this inquiry, he would be a philosopher.  But he illustrates the consequences that such intellectual pastimes may have in a man’s life, and in this regard he is an artist.  Among those consequences, his attention is arrested particularly by the last one, which he himself calls logical suicide in his Diary of a Writer .  In the installments for December 1876, indeed, he imagines the reasoning of “logical suicide.” Convinced that human existence is an utter absurdity for anyone without faith in immortality, the desperate man comes to the following conclusions: “Since in reply to my questions about happiness, I am told, through the intermediary of my consciousness, that I cannot be happy except in harmony with the great all, which I cannot conceive and shall never be in a position to conceive, it is evident…” “Since, finally, in this connection, I assume both the role of the plaintiff and that of the defendant, of the accused and of the judge, and since I consider this comedy perpetrated by nature altogether stupid, and since I even deem it humiliating for me to deign to play it…” “In my indisputable capacity of plaintiff and defendant, of judge and accused, I condemn that nature which, with such impudent nerve, brought me into being in order to suffer— I condemn it to be annihilated with me.” There remains a little humor in that position.  This suicide kills himself because, on the metaphysical plane, he is vexed .  In a certain sense he is taking his revenge.  This is his way of proving that he “will not be had.” It is known, however, that the same theme is embodied, but with the most wonderful generality, in Kirilov of The Possessed , likewise an advocate of logical suicide.  Kirilov the engineer declares somewhere that he wants to take his own life because it “is his idea.” Obviously the word must be taken in its proper sense.  It is for an idea, a thought, that he is getting ready for death.  This is the superior suicide.  Progressively, in a series of scenes in which Kirilov’s mask is gradually illuminated, the fatal thought driving him is revealed to us.  The engineer, in fact, goes back to the arguments of the Diary .  He feels that God is necessary and that he must exist.  But he knows that he does not and cannot exist.  “Why do you not realize,” he exclaims, “that this is sufficient reason for killing oneself?” That attitude involves likewise for him some of the absurd consequences.  Through indifference he accepts letting his suicide be used to the advantage of a cause he despises.  “I decided last night that I didn’t care.” And finally he prepares his deed with a mixed feeling of revolt and freedom.  “I shall kill myself in order to assert my insubordination, my new and dreadful liberty.” It is no longer a question of revenge, but of revolt.  Kirilov is consequently an absurd character—yet with this essential reservation: he kills himself.  But he himself explains this contradiction, and in such a way that at the same time he reveals the absurd secret in all its purity.  In truth, he adds to his fatal logic an extraordinary ambition which gives the character its full perspective: he wants to kill himself to become god.  The reasoning is classic in its clarity.  If God does not exist, Kirilov is god.  If God does not exist, Kirilov must kill himself.  Kirilov must therefore kill himself to become god.  That logic is absurd, but it is what is needed.  The interesting thing, however, is to give a meaning to that divinity brought to earth.  That amounts to clarifying the premise: “If God does not exist, I am god,” which still remains rather obscure.  It is important to note at the outset that the man who flaunts that mad claim is indeed of this world.  He performs his gymnastics every morning to preserve his health.  He is stirred by the joy of Chatov recovering his wife.  On a sheet of paper to be found after his death he wants to draw a face sticking out his tongue at “them.” He is childish and irascible, passionate, methodical, and sensitive.  Of the superman he has nothing but the logic and the obsession, whereas of man he has the whole catalogue.  Yet it is he who speaks calmly of his divinity.  He is not mad, or else Dostoevsky is.  Consequently it is not a megalomaniac’s illusion that excites him.  And taking the words in their specific sense would, in this instance, be ridiculous.  Kirilov himself helps us to understand.  In reply to a question from Stavrogin, he makes clear that he is not talking of a god-man.  It might be thought that this springs from concern to distinguish himself from Christ.  But in reality it is a matter of annexing Christ.  Kirilov in fact fancies for a moment that Jesus at his death did not find himself in Paradise .  He found out then that his torture had been useless.  “The laws of nature,” says the engineer, “made Christ live in the midst of falsehood and die for a falsehood.” Solely in this sense Jesus indeed personifies the whole human drama.  He is the complete man, being the one who realized the most absurd condition.  He is not the God-man but the man-god.  And, like him, each of us can be crucified and victimized—and is to a certain degree.  The divinity in question is therefore altogether terrestrial.  “For three years,” says Kirilov, “I sought the attribute of my divinity and I have found it.  The attribute of my divinity is independence.” Now can be seen the meaning of Kirilov’s premise: “If God does not exist, I am god.” To become god is merely to be free on this earth, not to serve an immortal being.  Above all, of course, it is drawing all the inferences from that painful independence.  If God exists, all depends on him and we can do nothing against his will.  If he does not exist, everything depends on us.  For Kirilov, as for Nietzsche, to kill God is to become god oneself; it is to realize on this earth the eternal life of which the Gospel speaks.  *4 But if this metaphysical crime is enough for man’s fulfillment, why add suicide? Why kill oneself and leave this world after having won freedom? That is contradictory.  Kirilov is well aware of this, for he adds: “If you feel that , you are a tsar and, far from killing yourself, you will live covered with glory.” But men in general do not know it.  They do not feel “that.” As in the time of Prometheus, they entertain blind hopes.  *5 They need to be shown the way and cannot do without preaching.  Consequently, Kirilov must kill himself out of love for humanity.  He must show his brothers a royal and difficult path on which he will be the first.  It is a pedagogical suicide.  Kirilov sacrifices himself, then.  But if he is crucified, he will not be victimized.  He remains the man-god, convinced of a death without future, imbued with evangelical melancholy.  “I,” he says, “am unhappy because I am obliged to assert my freedom.” But once he is dead and men are at last enlightened, this earth will be peopled with tsars and lighted up with human glory.  Kirilov’s pistol shot will be the signal for the last revolution.  Thus, it is not despair that urges him to death, but love of his neighbor for his own sake.  Before terminating in blood an indescribable spiritual adventure, Kirilov makes a remark as old as human suffering: “All is well.” This theme of suicide in Dostoevsky, then, is indeed an absurd theme.  Let us merely note before going on that Kirilov reappears in other characters who themselves set in motion additional absurd themes.  Stavrogin and Ivan Karamazov try out the absurd truths in practical life.  They are the ones liberated by Kirilov’s death.  They try their skill at being tsars.  Stavrogin leads an “ironic” life, and it is well known in what regard.  He arouses hatred around him.  And yet the key to the character is found in his farewell letter: “I have not been able to detest anything.” He is a tsar in indifference.  Ivan is likewise by refusing to surrender the royal powers of the mind.  To those who, like his brother, prove by their lives that it is essential to humiliate oneself in order to believe, he might reply that the condition is shameful.  His key word is: “Everything is permitted,” with the appropriate shade of melancholy.  Of course, like Nietzsche, the most famous of God’s assassins, he ends in madness.  But this is a risk worth running, and, faced with such tragic ends, the essential impulse of the absurd mind is to ask: “What does that prove?” * * * Thus the novels, like the Diary , propound the absurd question.  They establish logic unto death, exaltation, “dreadful” freedom, the glory of the tsars become human.  All is well, everything is permitted, and nothing is hateful—these are absurd judgments.  But what an amazing creation in which those creatures of fire and ice seem so familiar to us.  The passionate world of indifference that rumbles in their hearts does not seem at all monstrous to us.  We recognize in it our everyday anxieties.  And probably no one so much as Dostoevsky has managed to give the absurd world such familiar and tormenting charms.  Yet what is his conclusion? Two quotations will show the complete metaphysical reversal that leads the writer to other revelations.  The argument of the one who commits logical suicide having provoked protests from the critics, Dostoevsky in the following installments of the Diary amplifies his position and concludes thus: “If faith in immortality is so necessary to the human being (that without it he comes to the point of killing himself), it must therefore be the normal state of humanity.  Since this is the case, the immortality of the human soul exists without any doubt.” Then again in the last pages of his last novel, at the conclusion of that gigantic combat with God, some children ask Aliocha: “Karamazov, is it true what religion says, that we shall rise from the dead, that we shall see one another again?” And Aliocha answers: “Certainly, we shall see one another again, we shall joyfully tell one another everything that has happened.” Thus Kirilov, Stavrogin, and Ivan are defeated.  The Brothers Karamazov replies to The Possessed .  And it is indeed a conclusion.  Aliocha’s case is not ambiguous, as is that of Prince Muichkin.  Ill, the latter lives in a perpetual present, tinged with smiles and indifference, and that blissful state might be the eternal life of which the Prince speaks.  On the contrary, Aliocha clearly says: “We shall meet again.” There is no longer any question of suicide and of madness.  What is the use, for anyone who is sure of immortality and of its joys? Man exchanges his divinity for happiness.  “We shall joyfully tell one another everything that has happened.” Thus again Kirilov’s pistol rang out somewhere in Russia, but the world continued to cherish its blind hopes.  Men did not understand “that.” Consequently, it is not an absurd novelist addressing us, but an existential novelist.  Here, too, the leap is touching and gives its nobility to the art that inspires it.  It is a stirring acquiescence, riddled with doubts, uncertain and ardent.  Speaking of The Brothers Karamazov , Dostoevsky wrote: “The chief question that will be pursued throughout this book is the very one from which I have suffered consciously or unconsciously all life long: the existence of God.” It is hard to believe that a novel sufficed to transform into joyful certainty the suffering of a lifetime.  One commentator *6 correctly pointed out that Dostoevsky is on Ivan’s side and that the affirmative chapters took three months of effort whereas what he called “the blasphemies” were written in three weeks in a state of excitement.  There is not one of his characters who does not have that thorn in the flesh, who does not aggravate it or seek a remedy for it in sensation or immortality.  *7 In any case, let us remain with this doubt.  Here is a work which, in a chiaroscuro more gripping than the light of day, permits us to seize man’s struggle against his hopes.  Having reached the end, the creator makes his choice against his characters.  That contradiction thus allows us to make a distinction.  It is not an absurd work that is involved here, but a work that propounds the absurd problem.  Dostoevsky’s reply is humiliation, “shame” according to Stavrogin.  An absurd work, on the contrary, does not provide a reply; that is the whole difference.  Let us note this carefully in conclusion: what contradicts the absurd in that work is not its Christian character, but rather its announcing a future life.  It is possible to be Christian and absurd.  There are examples of Christians who do not believe in a future life.  In regard to the work of art, it should therefore be possible to define one of the directions of the absurd analysis that could have been anticipated in the preceding pages.  It leads to propounding “the absurdity of the Gospel.” It throws light upon this idea, fertile in repercussions, that convictions do not prevent incredulity.  On the contrary, it is easy to see that the author of The Possessed , familiar with these paths, in conclusion took a quite different way.  The surprising reply of the creator to his characters, of Dostoevsky to Kirilov, can indeed be summed up thus: existence is illusory and it is eternal.  Ephemeral Creation At this point I perceive, therefore, that hope cannot be eluded forever and that it can beset even those who wanted to be free of it.  This is the interest I find in the works discussed up to this point.  I could, at least in the realm of creation, list some truly absurd works.  *8 But everything must have a beginning.  The object of this quest is a certain fidelity.  The Church has been so harsh with heretics only because she deemed that there is no worse enemy than a child who has gone astray.  But the record of Gnostic effronteries and the persistence of Manichean currents have contributed more to the construction of orthodox dogma than all the prayers.  With due allowance, the same is true of the absurd.  One recognizes one’s course by discovering the paths that stray from it.  At the very conclusion of the absurd reasoning, in one of the attitudes dictated by its logic, it is not a matter of indifference to find hope coming back in under one of its most touching guises.  That shows the difficulty of the absurd ascesis .  Above all, it shows the necessity of unfailing alertness and thus confirms the general plan of this essay.  But if it is still too early to list absurd works, at least a conclusion can be reached as to the creative attitude, one of those which can complete absurd existence.  Art can never be so well served as by a negative thought.  Its dark and humiliated proceedings are as necessary to the understanding of a great work as black is to white.  To work and create “for nothing,” to sculpture in clay, to know that one’s creation has no future, to see one’s work destroyed in a day while being aware that fundamentally this has no more importance than building for centuries—this is the difficult wisdom that absurd thought sanctions.  Performing these two tasks simultaneously, negating on the one hand and magnifying on the other, is the way open to the absurd creator.  He must give the void its colors.  This leads to a special conception of the work of art.  Too often the work of a creator is looked upon as a series of isolated testimonies.  Thus, artist and man of letters are confused.  A profound thought is in a constant state of becoming; it adopts the experience of a life and assumes its shape.  Likewise, a man’s sole creation is strengthened in its successive and multiple aspects: his works.  One after another, they complement one another, correct or overtake one another, contradict one another too.  If something brings creation to an end, it is not the victorious and illusory cry of the blinded artist: “I have said everything,” but the death of the creator which closes his experience and the book of his genius.  That effort, that superhuman consciousness are not necessarily apparent to the reader.  There is no mystery in human creation.  Will performs this miracle.  But at least there is no true creation without a secret.  To be sure, a succession of works can be but a series of approximations of the same thought.  But it is possible to conceive of another type of creator proceeding by juxtaposition.  Their works may seem to be devoid of interrelations.  To a certain degree, they are contradictory.  But viewed all together, they resume their natural grouping.  From death, for instance, they derive their definitive significance.  They receive their most obvious light from the very life of their author.  At the moment of death, the succession of his works is but a collection of failures.  But if those failures all have the same resonance, the creator has managed to repeat the image of his own condition, to make the air echo with the sterile secret he possesses.  The effort to dominate is considerable here.  But human intelligence is up to much more.  It will merely indicate clearly the voluntary aspect of creation.  Elsewhere I have brought out the fact that human will had no other purpose than to maintain awareness.  But that could not do without discipline.  Of all the schools of patience and lucidity, creation is the most effective.  It is also the staggering evidence of man’s sole dignity: the dogged revolt against his condition, perseverance in an effort considered sterile.  It calls for a daily effort, self-mastery, a precise estimate of the limits of truth, measure, and strength.  It constitutes an ascesis .  All that “for nothing,” in order to repeat and mark time.  But perhaps the great work of art has less importance in itself than in the ordeal it demands of a man and the opportunity it provides him of overcoming his phantoms and approaching a little closer to his naked reality.  * * * Let there be no mistake in æsthetics.  It is not patient inquiry, the unceasing, sterile illustration of a thesis that I am calling for here.  Quite the contrary, if I have made myself clearly understood.  The thesis-novel, the work that proves, the most hateful of all, is the one that most often is inspired by a smug thought.  You demonstrate the truth you feel sure of possessing.  But those are ideas one launches, and ideas are the contrary of thought.  Those creators are philosophers, ashamed of themselves.  Those I am speaking of or whom I imagine are, on the contrary, lucid thinkers.  At a certain point where thought turns back on itself, they raise up the images of their works like the obvious symbols of a limited, mortal, and rebellious thought.  They perhaps prove something.  But those proofs are ones that the novelists provide for themselves rather than for the world in general.  The essential is that the novelists should triumph in the concrete and that this constitute their nobility.  This wholly carnal triumph has been prepared for them by a thought in which abstract powers have been humiliated.  When they are completely so, at the same time the flesh makes the creation shine forth in all its absurd luster.  After all, ironic philosophies produce passionate works.  Any thought that abandons unity glorifies diversity.  And diversity is the home of art.  The only thought to liberate the mind is that which leaves it alone, certain of its limits and of its impending end.  No doctrine tempts it.  It awaits the ripening of the work and of life.  Detached from it, the work will once more give a barely muffled voice to a soul forever freed from hope.  Or it will give voice to nothing if the creator, tired of his activity, intends to turn away.  That is equivalent.  * * * Thus, I ask of absurd creation what I required from thought—revolt, freedom, and diversity.  Later on it will manifest its utter futility.  In that daily effort in which intelligence and passion mingle and delight each other, the absurd man discovers a discipline that will make up the greatest of his strengths.  The required diligence, the doggedness and lucidity thus resemble the conqueror’s attitude.  To create is likewise to give a shape to one’s fate.  For all these characters, their work defines them at least as much as it is defined by them.  The actor taught us this: there is no frontier between being and appearing.  Let me repeat.  None of all this has any real meaning.  On the way to that liberty, there is still a progress to be made.  The final effort for these related minds, creator or conqueror, is to manage to free themselves also from their undertakings: succeed in granting that the very work, whether it be conquest, love, or creation, may well not be; consummate thus the utter futility of any individual life.  Indeed, that gives them more freedom in the realization of that work, just as becoming aware of the absurdity of life authorized them to plunge into it with every excess.  All that remains is a fate whose outcome alone is fatal.  Outside of that single fatality of death, everything, joy or happiness, is liberty.  A world remains of which man is the sole master.  What bound him was the illusion of another world.  The outcome of his thought, ceasing to be renunciatory, flowers in images.  It frolics—in myths, to be sure, but myths with no other depth than that of human suffering and, like it, inexhaustible.  Not the divine fable that amuses and blinds, but the terrestrial face, gesture, and drama in which are summed up a difficult wisdom and an ephemeral passion.  *1 It is curious to note that the most intellectual kind of painting, the one that tries to reduce reality to its essential elements, is ultimately but a visual delight.  All it has kept of the world is its color.  (This is apparent particularly in Léger.) *2 If you stop to think of it, this explains the worst novels.  Almost everybody considers himself capable of thinking and, to a certain degree, whether right or wrong, really does think.  Very few, on the contrary, can fancy themselves poets or artists in words.  But from the moment when thought won out over style, the mob invaded the novel.  That is not such a great evil as is said.  The best are led to make greater demands upon themselves.  As for those who succumb, they did not deserve to survive.  *3 Malraux’s work, for instance.  But it would have been necessary to deal at the same time with the social question which in fact cannot be avoided by absurd thought (even though that thought may put forward several solutions, very different from one another).  One must, however, limit oneself.  *4 “Stavrogin: ‘Do you believe in eternal life in the other world?’ Kirilov: ‘No, but in eternal life in this world.’” *5 “Man simply invented God in order not to kill himself.  That is the summary of universal history down to this moment.” *6 Boris de Schloezer.  *7 Gide’s curious and penetrating remark: almost all Dostoevsky’s heroes are polygamous.  *8 Melville’s Moby Dick , for instance.  The Absurd Man, The Myth of Sisyphus THE ABSURD MAN If Stavrogin believes, he does not think he believes.  If he does not believe, he does not think he does not believe.  —The Possessed “M Y FIELD ,” said Goethe, “is time.” That is indeed the absurd speech.  What, in fact, is the absurd man? He who, without negating it, does nothing for the eternal.  Not that nostalgia is foreign to him.  But he prefers his courage and his reasoning.  The first teaches him to live without appeal and to get along with what he has; the second informs him of his limits.  Assured of his temporally limited freedom, of his revolt devoid of future, and of his mortal consciousness, he lives out his adventure within the span of his lifetime.  That is his field, that is his action, which he shields from any judgment but his own.  A greater life cannot mean for him another life.  That would be unfair.  I am not even speaking here of that paltry eternity that is called posterity.  Mme Roland relied on herself.  That rashness was taught a lesson.  Posterity is glad to quote her remark, but forgets to judge it.  Mme Roland is indifferent to posterity.  There can be no question of holding forth on ethics.  I have seen people behave badly with great morality and I note every day that integrity has no need of rules.  There is but one moral code that the absurd man can accept, the one that is not separated from God: the one that is dictated.  But it so happens that he lives outside that God.  As for the others (I mean also immoralism), the absurd man sees nothing in them but justifications and he has nothing to justify.  I start out here from the principle of his innocence.  That innocence is to be feared.  “Everything is permitted,” exclaims Ivan Karamazov.  That, too, smacks of the absurd.  But on condition that it not be taken in the vulgar sense.  I don’t know whether or not it has been sufficiently pointed out that it is not an outburst of relief or of joy, but rather a bitter acknowledgment of a fact.  The certainty of a God giving a meaning to life far surpasses in attractiveness the ability to behave badly with impunity.  The choice would not be hard to make.  But there is no choice, and that is where the bitterness comes in.  The absurd does not liberate; it binds.  It does not authorize all actions.  “Everything is permitted” does not mean that nothing is forbidden.  The absurd merely confers an equivalence on the consequences of those actions.  It does not recommend crime, for this would be childish, but it restores to remorse its futility.  Likewise, if all experiences are indifferent, that of duty is as legitimate as any other.  One can be virtuous through a whim.  All systems of morality are based on the idea that an action has consequences that legitimize or cancel it.  A mind imbued with the absurd merely judges that those consequences must be considered calmly.  It is ready to pay up.  In other words, there may be responsible persons, but there are no guilty ones, in its opinion.  At very most, such a mind will consent to use past experience as a basis for its future actions.  Time will prolong time, and life will serve life.  In this field that is both limited and bulging with possibilities, everything in himself, except his lucidity, seems unforeseeable to him.  What rule, then, could emanate from that unreasonable order? The only truth that might seem instructive to him is not formal: it comes to life and unfolds in men.  The absurd mind cannot so much expect ethical rules at the end of its reasoning as, rather, illustrations and the breath of human lives.  The few following images are of this type.  They prolong the absurd reasoning by giving it a specific attitude and their warmth.  Do I need to develop the idea that an example is not necessarily an example to be followed (even less so, if possible, in the absurd world) and that these illustrations are not therefore models? Besides the fact that a certain vocation is required for this, one becomes ridiculous, with all due allowance, when drawing from Rousseau the conclusion that one must walk on all fours and from Nietzsche that one must maltreat one’s mother.  “It is essential to be absurd,” writes a modern author, “it is not essential to be a dupe.” The attitudes of which I shall treat can assume their whole meaning only through consideration of their contraries.  A sub-clerk in the post office is the equal of a conqueror if consciousness is common to them.  All experiences are indifferent in this regard.  There are some that do either a service or a disservice to man.  They do him a service if he is conscious.  Otherwise, that has no importance: a man’s failures imply judgment, not of circumstances, but of himself.  I am choosing solely men who aim only to expend themselves or whom I see to be expending themselves.  That has no further implications.  For the moment I want to speak only of a world in which thoughts, like lives, are devoid of future.  Everything that makes man work and get excited utilizes hope.  The sole thought that is not mendacious is therefore a sterile thought.  In the absurd world the value of a notion or of a life is measured by its sterility.  Don Juanism If it were sufficient to love, things would be too easy.  The more one loves, the stronger the absurd grows.  It is not through lack of love that Don Juan goes from woman to woman.  It is ridiculous to represent him as a mystic in quest of total love.  But it is indeed because he loves them with the same passion and each time with his whole self that he must repeat his gift and his profound quest.  Whence each woman hopes to give him what no one has ever given him.  Each time they are utterly wrong and merely manage to make him feel the need of that repetition.  “At last,” exclaims one of them, “I have given you love.” Can we be surprised that Don Juan laughs at this? “At last? No,” he says, “but once more.” Why should it be essential to love rarely in order to love much? * * * Is Don Juan melancholy? This is not likely.  I shall barely have recourse to the legend.  That laugh, the conquering insolence, that playfulness and love of the theater are all clear and joyous.  Every healthy creature tends to multiply himself.  So it is with Don Juan.  But, furthermore, melancholy people have two reasons for being so: they don’t know or they hope.  Don Juan knows and does not hope.  He reminds one of those artists who know their limits, never go beyond them, and in that precarious interval in which they take their spiritual stand enjoy all the wonderful ease of masters.  And that is indeed genius: the intelligence that knows its frontiers.  Up to the frontier of physical death Don Juan is ignorant of melancholy.  The moment he knows, his laugh bursts forth and makes one forgive everything.  He was melancholy at the time when he hoped.  Today, on the mouth of that woman he recognizes the bitter and comforting taste of the only knowledge.  Bitter? Barely: that necessary imperfection that makes happiness perceptible! It is quite false to try to see in Don Juan a man brought up on Ecclesiastes.  For nothing is vanity to him except the hope of another life.  He proves this because he gambles that other life against heaven itself.  Longing for desire killed by satisfaction, that commonplace of the impotent man, does not belong to him.  That is all right for Faust, who believed in God enough to sell himself to the devil.  For Don Juan the thing is simpler.  Molina’s Burlador ever replies to the threats of hell: “What a long respite you give me!” What comes after death is futile, and what a long succession of days for whoever knows how to be alive! Faust craved worldly goods; the poor man had only to stretch out his hand.  It already amounted to selling his soul when he was unable to gladden it.  As for satiety, Don Juan insists upon it, on the contrary.  If he leaves a woman it is not absolutely because he has ceased to desire her.  A beautiful woman is always desirable.  But he desires another, and no, this is not the same thing.  This life gratifies his every wish, and nothing is worse than losing it.  This madman is a great wise man.  But men who live on hope do not thrive in this universe where kindness yields to generosity, affection to virile silence, and communion to solitary courage.  And all hasten to say: “He was a weakling, an idealist or a saint.” One has to disparage the greatness that insults.  * * * People are sufficiently annoyed (or that smile of complicity that debases what it admires) by Don Juan’s speeches and by that same remark that he uses on all women.  But to anyone who seeks quantity in his joys, the only thing that matters is efficacy.  What is the use of complicating the passwords that have stood the test? No one, neither the woman nor the man, listens to them, but rather to the voice that pronounces them.  They are the rule, the convention, and the courtesy.  After they are spoken the most important still remains to be done.  Don Juan is already getting ready for it.  Why should he give himself a problem in morality? He is not like Milosz’s Mañara, who damns himself through a desire to be a saint.  Hell for him is a thing to be provoked.  He has but one reply to divine wrath, and that is human honor: “I have honor,” he says to the Commander, “and I am keeping my promise because I am a knight.” But it would be just as great an error to make an immoralist of him.  In this regard, he is “like everyone else”: he has the moral code of his likes and dislikes.  Don Juan can be properly understood only by constant reference to what he commonly symbolizes: the ordinary seducer and the sexual athlete.  He is an ordinary seducer.  *1 Except for the difference that he is conscious, and that is why he is absurd.  A seducer who has become lucid will not change for all that.  Seducing is his condition in life.  Only in novels does one change condition or become better.  Yet it can be said that at the same time nothing is changed and everything is transformed.  What Don Juan realizes in action is an ethic of quantity, whereas the saint, on the contrary, tends toward quality.  Not to believe in the profound meaning of things belongs to the absurd man.  As for those cordial or wonder-struck faces, he eyes them, stores them up, and does not pause over them.  Time keeps up with him.  The absurd man is he who is not apart from time.  Don Juan does not think of “collecting” women.  He exhausts their number and with them his chances of life.  “Collecting” amounts to being capable of living off one’s past.  But he rejects regret, that other form of hope.  He is incapable of looking at portraits.  * * * Is he selfish for all that? In his way, probably.  But here, too, it is essential to understand one another.  There are those who are made for living and those who are made for loving.  At least Don Juan would be inclined to say so.  But he would do so in a very few words such as he is capable of choosing.  For the love we are speaking of here is clothed in illusions of the eternal.  As all the specialists in passion teach us, there is no eternal love but what is thwarted.  There is scarcely any passion without struggle.  Such a love culminates only in the ultimate contradiction of death.  One must be Werther or nothing.  There, too, there are several ways of committing suicide, one of which is the total gift and forgetfulness of self.  Don Juan, as well as anyone else, knows that this can be stirring.  But he is one of the very few who know that this is not the important thing.  He knows just as well that those who turn away from all personal life through a great love enrich themselves perhaps but certainly impoverish those their love has chosen.  A mother or a passionate wife necessarily has a closed heart, for it is turned away from the world.  A single emotion, a single creature, a single face, but all is devoured.  Quite a different love disturbs Don Juan, and this one is liberating.  It brings with it all the faces in the world, and its tremor comes from the fact that it knows itself to be mortal.  Don Juan has chosen to be nothing.  For him it is a matter of seeing clearly.  We call love what binds us to certain creatures only by reference to a collective way of seeing for which books and legends are responsible.  But of love I know only that mixture of desire, affection, and intelligence that binds me to this or that creature.  That compound is not the same for another person.  I do not have the right to cover all these experiences with the same name.  This exempts one from conducting them with the same gestures.  The absurd man multiplies here again what he cannot unify.  Thus he discovers a new way of being which liberates him at least as much as it liberates those who approach him.  There is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short-lived and exceptional.  All those deaths and all those rebirths gathered together as in a sheaf make up for Don Juan the flowering of his life.  It is his way of giving and of vivifying.  I let it be decided whether or not one can speak of selfishness.  * * * I think at this point of all those who absolutely insist that Don Juan be punished.  Not only in another life, but even in this one.  I think of all those tales, legends, and laughs about the aged Don Juan.  But Don Juan is already ready.  To a conscious man old age and what it portends are not a surprise.  Indeed, he is conscious only in so far as he does not conceal its horror from himself.  There was in Athens a temple dedicated to old age.  Children were taken there.  As for Don Juan, the more people laugh at him, the more his figure stands out.  Thereby he rejects the one the romantics lent him.  No one wants to laugh at that tormented, pitiful Don Juan.  He is pitied; heaven itself will redeem him? But that’s not it.  In the universe of which Don Juan has a glimpse, ridicule too is included.  He would consider it normal to be chastised.  That is the rule of the game.  And, indeed, it is typical of his nobility to have accepted all the rules of the game.  Yet he knows he is right and that there can be no question of punishment.  A fate is not a punishment.  That is his crime, and how easy it is to understand why the men of God call down punishment on his head.  He achieves a knowledge without illusions which negates everything they profess.  Loving and possessing, conquering and consuming—that is his way of knowing.  (There is significance in that favorite Scriptural word that calls the carnal act “knowing.”) He is their worst enemy to the extent that he is ignorant of them.  A chronicler relates that the true Burlador died assassinated by Franciscans who wanted “to put an end to the excesses and blasphemies of Don Juan, whose birth assured him impunity.” Then they proclaimed that heaven had struck him down.  No one has proved that strange end.  Nor has anyone proved the contrary.  But without wondering if it is probable, I can say that it is logical.  I want merely to single out at this point the word “birth” and to play on words: it was the fact of living that assured his innocence.  It was from death alone that he derived a guilt now become legendary.  What else does that stone Commander signify, that cold statue set in motion to punish the blood and courage that dared to think? All the powers of eternal Reason, of order, of universal morality, all the foreign grandeur of a God open to wrath are summed up in him.  That gigantic and soulless stone merely symbolizes the forces that Don Juan negated forever.  But the Commander’s mission stops there.  The thunder and lightning can return to the imitation heaven whence they were called forth.  The real tragedy takes place quite apart from them.  No, it was not under a stone hand that Don Juan met his death.  I am inclined to believe in the legendary bravado, in that mad laughter of the healthy man provoking a non-existent God.  But, above all, I believe that on that evening when Don Juan was waiting at Anna’s the Commander didn’t come, and that after midnight the blasphemer must have felt the dreadful bitterness of those who have been right.  I accept even more readily the account of his life that has him eventually burying himself in a monastery.  Not that the edifying aspect of the story can be considered probable.  What refuge can he go ask of God? But this symbolizes rather the logical outcome of a life completely imbued with the absurd, the grim ending of an existence turned toward short-lived joys.  At this point sensual pleasure winds up in asceticism.  It is essential to realize that they may be, as it were, the two aspects of the same destitution.  What more ghastly image can be called up than that of a man betrayed by his body who, simply because he did not die in time, lives out the comedy while awaiting the end, face to face with that God he does not adore, serving him as he served life, kneeling before a void and arms outstretched toward a heaven without eloquence that he knows to be also without depth? I see Don Juan in a cell of one of those Spanish monasteries lost on a hilltop.  And if he contemplates anything at all, it is not the ghosts of past loves, but perhaps, through a narrow slit in the sun-baked wall, some silent Spanish plain, a noble, soulless land in which he recognizes himself.  Yes, it is on this melancholy and radiant image that the curtain must he rung down.  The ultimate end, awaited but never desired, the ultimate end is negligible.  Drama “The play’s the thing,” says Hamlet, “wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.” “Catch” is indeed the word.  For conscience moves swiftly or withdraws within itself.  It has to be caught on the wing, at that barely perceptible moment when it glances fleetingly at itself.  The everyday man does not enjoy tarrying.  Everything, on the contrary, hurries him onward.  But at the same time nothing interests him more than himself, especially his potentialities.  Whence his interest in the theater, in the show, where so many fates are offered him, where he can accept the poetry without feeling the sorrow.  There at least can be recognized the thoughtless man, and he continues to hasten toward some hope or other.  The absurd man begins where that one leaves off, where, ceasing to admire the play, the mind wants to enter in.  Entering into all these lives, experiencing them in their diversity, amounts to acting them out.  I am not saying that actors in general obey that impulse, that they are absurd men, but that their fate is an absurd fate which might charm and attract a lucid heart.  It is necessary to establish this in order to grasp without misunderstanding what will follow.  The actor’s realm is that of the fleeting.  Of all kinds of fame, it is known, his is the most ephemeral.  At least, this is said in conversation.  But all kinds of fame are ephemeral.  From the point of view of Sirius, Goethe’s works in ten thousand years will be dust and his name forgotten.  Perhaps a handful of archæologists will look for “evidence” as to our era.  That idea has always contained a lesson.  Seriously meditated upon, it reduces our perturbations to the profound nobility that is found in indifference.  Above all, it directs our concerns toward what is most certain—that is, toward the immediate.  Of all kinds of fame the least deceptive is the one that is lived.  Hence the actor has chosen multiple fame, the fame that is hallowed and tested.  From the fact that everything is to die someday he draws the best conclusion.  An actor succeeds or does not succeed.  A writer has some hope even if he is not appreciated.  He assumes that his works will bear witness to what he was.  At best the actor will leave us a photograph, and nothing of what he was himself, his gestures and his silences, his gasping or his panting with love, will come down to us.  For him, not to be known is not to act, and not acting is dying a hundred times with all the creatures he would have brought to life or resuscitated.  * * * Why should we be surprised to find a fleeting fame built upon the most ephemeral of creations? The actor has three hours to be Iago or Alceste, Phèdre or Gloucester.  In that short space of time he makes them come to life and die on fifty square yards of boards.  Never has the absurd been so well illustrated or at such length.  What more revelatory epitome can be imagined than those marvelous lives, those exceptional and total destinies unfolding for a few hours within a stage set? Off the stage, Sigismundo ceases to count.  Two hours later he is seen dining out.  Then it is, perhaps, that life is a dream.  But after Sigismundo comes another.  The hero suffering from uncertainty takes the place of the man roaring for his revenge.  By thus sweeping over centuries and minds, by miming man as he can be and as he is, the actor has much in common with that other absurd individual, the traveler.  Like him, he drains something and is constantly on the move.  He is a traveler in time and, for the best, the hunted traveler, pursued by souls.  If ever the ethics of quantity could find sustenance, it is indeed on that strange stage.  To what degree the actor benefits from the characters is hard to say.  But that is not the important thing.  It is merely a matter of knowing how far he identifies himself with those irreplaceable lives.  It often happens that he carries them with him, that they somewhat overflow the time and place in which they were born.  They accompany the actor, who cannot very readily separate himself from what he has been.  Occasionally when reaching for his glass he resumes Hamlet’s gesture of raising his cup.  No, the distance separating him from the creatures into whom he infuses life is not so great.  He abundantly illustrates every month or every day that so suggestive truth that there is no frontier between what a man wants to be and what he is.  Always concerned with better representing, he demonstrates to what a degree appearing creates being.  For that is his art—to simulate absolutely, to project himself as deeply as possible into lives that are not his own.  At the end of his effort his vocation becomes clear: to apply himself wholeheartedly to being nothing or to being several.  The narrower the limits allotted him for creating his character, the more necessary his talent.  He will die in three hours under the mask he has assumed today.  Within three hours he must experience and express a whole exceptional life.  That is called losing oneself to find oneself.  In those three hours he travels the whole course of the dead-end path that the man in the audience takes a lifetime to cover.  * * * A mime of the ephemeral, the actor trains and perfects himself only in appearances.  The theatrical convention is that the heart expresses itself and communicates itself only through gestures and in the body—or through the voice, which is as much of the soul as of the body.  The rule of that art insists that everything be magnified and translated into flesh.  If it were essential on the stage to love as people really love, to employ that irreplaceable voice of the heart, to look as people contemplate in life, our speech would be in code.  But here silences must make themselves heard.  Love speaks up louder, and immobility itself becomes spectacular.  The body is king.  Not everyone can be “theatrical,” and this unjustly maligned word covers a whole æsthetic and a whole ethic.  Half a man’s life is spent in implying, in turning away, and in keeping silent.  Here the actor is the intruder.  He breaks the spell chaining that soul, and at last the passions can rush onto their stage.  They speak in every gesture; they live only through shouts and cries.  Thus the actor creates his characters for display.  He outlines or sculptures them and slips into their imaginary form, transfusing his blood into their phantoms.  I am of course speaking of great drama, the kind that gives the actor an opportunity to fulfill his wholly physical fate.  Take Shakespeare, for instance.  In that impulsive drama the physical passions lead the dance.  They explain everything.  Without them all would collapse.  Never would King Lear keep the appointment set by madness without the brutal gesture that exiles Cordelia and condemns Edgar.  It is just that the unfolding of that tragedy should thenceforth be dominated by madness.  Souls are given over to the demons and their saraband.  No fewer than four madmen: one by trade, another by intention, and the last two through suffering—four disordered bodies, four unutterable aspects of a single condition.  The very scale of the human body is inadequate.  The mask and the buskin, the make-up that reduces and accentuates the face in its essential elements, the costume that exaggerates and simplifies—that universe sacrifices everything to appearance and is made solely for the eye.  Through an absurd miracle, it is the body that also brings knowledge.  I should never really understand Iago unless I played his part.  It is not enough to hear him, for I grasp him only at the moment when I see him.  Of the absurd character the actor consequently has the monotony, that single, oppressive silhouette, simultaneously strange and familiar, that he carries about from hero to hero.  There, too, the great dramatic work contributes to this unity of tone.  *2 This is where the actor contradicts himself: the same and yet so various, so many souls summed up in a single body.  Yet it is the absurd contradiction itself, that individual who wants to achieve everything and live everything, that useless attempt, that ineffectual persistence.  What always contradicts itself nevertheless joins in him.  He is at that point where body and mind converge, where the mind, tired of its defeats, turns toward its most faithful ally.  “And blest are those,” says Hamlet, “whose blood and judgment are so well commingled that they are not a pipe for fortune’s finger to sound what stop she please.” * * * How could the Church have failed to condemn such a practice on the part of the actor? She repudiated in that art the heretical multiplication of souls, the emotional debauch, the scandalous presumption of a mind that objects to living but one life and hurls itself into all forms of excess.  She proscribed in them that preference for the present and that triumph of Proteus which are the negation of everything she teaches.  Eternity is not a game.  A mind foolish enough to prefer a comedy to eternity has lost its salvation.  Between “everywhere” and “forever” there is no compromise.  Whence that much maligned profession can give rise to a tremendous spiritual conflict.  “What matters,” said Nietzsche, “is not eternal life but eternal vivacity.” All drama is, in fact, in this choice.  Adrienne Lecouvreur on her deathbed was willing to confess and receive communion, but refused to abjure her profession.  She thereby lost the benefit of the confession.  Did this not amount, in effect, to choosing her absorbing passion in preference to God? And that woman in the death throes refusing in tears to repudiate what she called her art gave evidence of a greatness that she never achieved behind the footlights.  This was her finest role and the hardest one to play.  Choosing between heaven and a ridiculous fidelity, preferring oneself to eternity or losing oneself in God is the age-old tragedy in which each must play his part.  The actors of the era knew they were excommunicated.  Entering the profession amounted to choosing Hell.  And the Church discerned in them her worst enemies.  A few men of letters protest: “What! Refuse the last rites to Molière!” But that was just, and especially in one who died onstage and finished under the actor’s make-up a life entirely devoted to dispersion.  In his case genius is invoked, which excuses everything.  But genius excuses nothing, just because it refuses to do so.  The actor knew at that time what punishment was in store for him.  But what significance could such vague threats have compared to the final punishment that life itself was reserving for him? This was the one that he felt in advance and accepted wholly.  To the actor as to the absurd man, a premature death is irreparable.  Nothing can make up for the sum of faces and centuries he would otherwise have traversed.  But in any case, one has to die.  For the actor is doubtless everywhere, but time sweeps him along, too, and makes its impression with him.  It requires but a little imagination to feel what an actor’s fate means.  It is in time that he makes up and enumerates his characters.  It is in time likewise that he learns to dominate them.  The greater number of different lives he has lived, the more aloof he can be from them.  The time comes when he must die to the stage and for the world.  What he has lived faces him.  He sees clearly.  He feels the harrowing and irreplaceable quality of that adventure.  He knows and can now die.  There are homes for aged actors.  Conquest “No,” says the conqueror, “don’t assume that because I love action I have had to forget how to think.  On the contrary I can thoroughly define what I believe.  For I believe it firmly and I see it surely and clearly.  Beware of those who say: ‘I know this too well to be able to express it.’ For if they cannot do so, this is because they don’t know it or because out of laziness they stopped at the outer crust.  “I have not many opinions.  At the end of a life man notices that he has spent years becoming sure of a single truth.  But a single truth, if it is obvious, is enough to guide an existence.  As for me, I decidedly have something to say about the individual.  One must speak of him bluntly and, if need be, with the appropriate contempt.  “A man is more a man through the things he keeps to himself than through those he says.  There are many that I shall keep to myself.  But I firmly believe that all those who have judged the individual have done so with much less experience than we on which to base their judgment.  The intelligence, the stirring intelligence perhaps foresaw what it was essential to note.  But the era, its ruins, and its blood overwhelm us with facts.  It was possible for ancient nations, and even for more recent ones down to our machine age, to weigh one against the other the virtues of society and of the individual, to try to find out which was to serve the other.  To begin with, that was possible by virtue of that stubborn aberration in man’s heart according to which human beings were created to serve or be served.  In the second place, it was possible because neither society nor the individual had yet revealed all their ability.  “I have seen bright minds express astonishment at the masterpieces of Dutch painters born at the height of the bloody wars in Flanders, be amazed by the prayers of Silesian mystics brought up during the frightful Thirty Years’ War.  Eternal values survive secular turmoils before their astonished eyes.  But there has been progress since.  The painters of today are deprived of such serenity.  Even if they have basically the heart the creator needs—I mean the closed heart—it is of no use; for everyone, including the saint himself, is mobilized.  This is perhaps what I have felt most deeply.  At every form that miscarries in the trenches, at every outline, metaphor, or prayer crushed under steel, the eternal loses a round.  Conscious that I cannot stand aloof from my time, I have decided to be an integral part of it.  This is why I esteem the individual only because he strikes me as ridiculous and humiliated.  Knowing that there are no victorious causes, I have a liking for lost causes: they require an uncontaminated soul, equal to its defeat as to its temporary victories.  For anyone who feels bound up with this world’s fate, the clash of civilizations has something agonizing about it.  I have made that anguish mine at the same time that I wanted to join in.  Between history and the eternal I have chosen history because I like certainties.  Of it, at least, I am certain, and how can I deny this force crushing me? “There always comes a time when one must choose between contemplation and action.  This is called becoming a man.  Such wrenches are dreadful.  But for a proud heart there can be no compromise.  There is God or time, that cross or this sword.  This world has a higher meaning that transcends its worries, or nothing is true but those worries.  One must live with time and die with it, or else elude it for a greater life.  I know that one can compromise and live in the world while believing in the eternal.  That is called accepting.  But I loathe this term and want all or nothing.  If I choose action, don’t think that contemplation is like an unknown country to me.  But it cannot give me everything, and, deprived of the eternal, I want to ally myself with time.  I do not want to put down to my account either nostalgia or bitterness, and I merely want to see clearly.  I tell you, tomorrow you will be mobilized.  For you and for me that is a liberation.  The individual can do nothing and yet he can do everything.  In that wonderful unattached state you understand why I exalt and crush him at one and the same time.  It is the world that pulverizes him and I who liberate him.  I provide him with all his rights.  * * * “Conquerors know that action is in itself useless.  There is but one useful action, that of remaking man and the earth.  I shall never remake men.  But one must do as if.’ For the path of struggle leads me to the flesh.  Even humiliated, the flesh is my only certainty.  I can live only on it.  The creature is my native land.  This is why I have chosen this absurd and ineffectual effort.  This is why I am on the side of the struggle.  The epoch lends itself to this, as I have said.  Hitherto the greatness of a conqueror was geographical.  It was measured by the extent of the conquered territories.  There is a reason why the word has changed in meaning and has ceased to signify the victorious general.  The greatness has changed camp.  It lies in protest and the blind-alley sacrifice.  There, too, it is not through a preference for defeat.  Victory would be desirable.  But there is but one victory, and it is eternal.  That is the one I shall never have.  That is where I stumble and cling.  A revolution is always accomplished against the gods, beginning with the revolution of Prometheus, the first of modern conquerors.  It is man’s demands made against his fate; the demands of the poor are but a pretext.  Yet I can seize that spirit only in its historical act, and that is where I make contact with it.  Don’t assume, however, that I take pleasure in it: opposite the essential contradiction, I maintain my human contradiction.  I establish my lucidity in the midst of what negates it.  I exalt man before what crushes him, and my freedom, my revolt, and my passion come together then in that tension, that lucidity, and that vast repetition.  “Yes, man is his own end.  And he is his only end.  If he aims to be something, it is in this life.  Now I know it only too well.  Conquerors sometimes talk of vanquishing and overcoming.  But it is always ‘overcoming oneself that they mean.  You are well aware of what that means.  Every man has felt himself to be the equal of a god at certain moments.  At least, this is the way it is expressed.  But this comes from the fact that in a flash he felt the amazing grandeur of the human mind.  The conquerors are merely those among men who are conscious enough of their strength to be sure of living constantly on those heights and fully aware of that grandeur.  It is a question of arithmetic, of more or less.  The conquerors are capable of the more.  But they are capable of no more than man himself when he wants.  This is why they never leave the human crucible, plunging into the seething soul of revolutions.  “There they find the creature mutilated, but they also encounter there the only values they like and admire, man and his silence.  This is both their destitution and their wealth.  There is but one luxury for them—that of human relations.  How can one fail to realize that in this vulnerable universe everything that is human and solely human assumes a more vivid meaning? Taut faces, threatened fraternity, such strong and chaste friendship among men—these are the true riches because they are transitory.  In their midst the mind is most aware of its powers and limitations.  That is to say, its efficacity.  Some have spoken of genius.  But genius is easy to say; I prefer the intelligence.  It must be said that it can be magnificent then.  It lights up this desert and dominates it.  It knows its obligations and illustrates them.  It will die at the same time as this body.  But knowing this constitutes its freedom.  * * * “We are not ignorant of the fact that all churches are against us.  A heart so keyed up eludes the eternal, and all churches, divine or political, lay claim to the eternal.  Happiness and courage, retribution or justice are secondary ends for them.  It is a doctrine they bring, and one must subscribe to it.  But I have no concern with ideas or with the eternal.  The truths that come within my scope can be touched with the hand.  I cannot separate from them.  This is why you cannot base anything on me: nothing of the conqueror lasts, not even his doctrines.  “At the end of all that, despite everything, is death.  We know also that it ends everything.  This is why those cemeteries all over Europe, which obsess some among us, are hideous.  People beautify only what they love, and death repels us and tires our patience.  It, too, is to be conquered.  The last Carrara, a prisoner in Padua emptied by the plague and besieged by the Venetians, ran screaming through the halls of his deserted palace: he was calling on the devil and asking him for death.  This was a way of overcoming it.  And it is likewise a mark of courage characteristic of the Occident to have made so ugly the places where death thinks itself honored.  In the rebel’s universe, death exalts injustice.  It is the supreme abuse.  “Others, without compromising either, have chosen the eternal and denounced the illusion of this world.  Their cemeteries smile amid numerous flowers and birds.  That suits the conqueror and gives him a clear image of what he has rejected.  He has chosen, on the contrary, the black iron fence or the potter’s field.  The best among the men of God occasionally are seized with fright mingled with consideration and pity for minds that can live with such an image of their death.  Yet those minds derive their strength and justification from this.  Our fate stands before us and we provoke him.  Less out of pride than out of awareness of our ineffectual condition.  We, too, sometimes feel pity for ourselves.  It is the only compassion that seems acceptable to us: a feeling that perhaps you hardly understand and that seems to you scarcely virile.  Yet the most daring among us are the ones who feel it.  But we call the lucid ones virile and we do not want a strength that is apart from lucidity.” * * * Let me repeat that these images do not propose moral codes and involve no judgments: they are sketches.  They merely represent a style of life.  The lover, the actor, or the adventurer plays the absurd.  But equally well, if he wishes, the chaste man, the civil servant, or the president of the Republic.  It is enough to know and to mask nothing.  In Italian museums are sometimes found little painted screens that the priest used to hold in front of the face of condemned men to hide the scaffold from them.  The leap in all its forms, rushing into the divine or the eternal, surrendering to the illusions of the everyday or of the idea—all these screens hide the absurd.  But there are civil servants without screens, and they are the ones of whom I mean to speak.  I have chosen the most extreme ones.  At this level the absurd gives them a royal power.  It is true that those princes are without a kingdom.  But they have this advantage over others: they know that all royalties are illusory.  They know that is their whole nobility, and it is useless to speak in relation to them of hidden misfortune or the ashes of disillusion.  Being deprived of hope is not despairing.  The flames of earth are surely worth celestial perfumes.  Neither I nor anyone can judge them here.  They are not striving to be better; they are attempting to be consistent.  If the term “wise man” can be applied to the man who lives on what he has without speculating on what he has not, then they are wise men.  One of them, a conqueror but in the realm of mind, a Don Juan but of knowledge, an actor but of the intelligence, knows this better than anyone: “You nowise deserve a privilege on earth and in heaven for having brought to perfection your dear little meek sheep; you nonetheless continue to be at best a ridiculous dear little sheep with horns and nothing more—even supposing that you do not burst with vanity and do not create a scandal by posing as a judge.” In any case, it was essential to restore to the absurd reasoning more cordial examples.  The imagination can add many others, inseparable from time and exile, who likewise know how to live in harmony with a universe without future and without weakness.  This absurd, godless world is, then, peopled with men who think clearly and have ceased to hope.  And I have not yet spoken of the most absurd character, who is the creator.  *1 In the fullest sense and with his faults.  A healthy attitude also includes faults.  *2 At this point I am thinking of Molière’s Alceste.  Everything is so simple, so obvious and so coarse.  Alceste against Philinte, Célimène against Elianthe, the whole subject in the absurd consequence of a nature carried to its extreme, and the verse itself, the “bad verse,” barely accented like the monotony of the character’s nature.  Fear and Trembling Problema I Is There a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical? The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which can be put from another point of view by saying that it applies at every moment.  It rests immanently in itself, has nothing outside itself that is its telos end, purpose but is itself the telos for everything outside, and when that is taken up into it, it has no further to go.  Seen as an immediate, no more than sensate and psychic, being, the single individual is the particular that has its telos in the universal, and the individual’s ethical task is always to express himself in this, to abrogate his particularity so as to become the universal.  As soon as the single individual wants to assert himself in his particularity, in direct opposition to the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.  Whenever, having entered the universal, the single individual feels an urge to assert his particularity, he is in a state of temptation, from which he can extricate himself only by surrendering his particularity to the universal in repentance.  If that is the highest that can be said of man and his existence, then the ethical and a person’s eternal blessedness, which is his telos in all eternity and at every moment, are identical; for in that case it would be a contradiction to say that one surrendered that telos (i.e.  suspended it teleologically) since by suspending the telos one would be forfeiting it, while what is said to be suspended in this sense is not forfeited but preserved in something higher, the latter being precisely its telos.  If that is the case, then Hegel is right in his ‘Good and Conscience’ where he discusses man seen merely as the single individual and regards this way of seeing him as a ‘moral form of evil’ to be annulled in the teleology of the ethical life, so that the individual who stays at this stage is either in sin or in a state of temptation.  Where Hegel goes wrong, on the other hand, is in talking about faith, in not protesting loudly and clearly against the honour and glory enjoyed by Abraham as the father of faith when he should really be remitted to some lower court for trial and exposed as a murderer.  For faith is just this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, though in such a way, be it noted, that the movement is repeated, that is, that, having been in the universal, the single individual now sets himself apart as the particular above the universal.  If that is not faith, then Abraham is done for and faith has never existed in the world, just because it has always existed.  For if the ethical life is the highest and nothing incommensurable is left over in man, except in the sense of what is evil, i.e.  the single individual who is to be expressed in the universal, then one needs no other categories than those of the Greek philosophers, or whatever can be logically deduced from them.  This is something Hegel, who has after all made some study of the Greeks, ought not to have kept quiet about.  One not infrequently hears people who prefer to lose themselves in clichés rather than studies say that light shines over the Christian world, while paganism is shrouded in darkness.  This kind of talk has always struck me as strange, since any reasonably deep thinker, any reasonably serious artist will still seek rejuvenation in the eternal youth of the Greeks.  The explanation may be that they know not what to say, only that they have to say something.  There is nothing wrong with saying that paganism did not have faith, but if this is to mean anything one must be a little clearer what one means by faith, otherwise one falls back into those clichés.  It is easy to explain the whole of existence, faith included, and he is not the worst reckoner in life who counts on being admired for having such an explanation: for it is as Boileau says: ‘un sot trouve toujours un plus sot, qui l’admire’ ‘a fool can always find a greater fool who admires him’.  Faith is just this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before the latter, not as subordinate but superior, though in such a way, be it noted, that it is the single individual who, having been subordinate to the universal as the particular, now by means of the universal becomes that individual who, as the particular, stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.  This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation occurs precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains in all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.  And yet faith is this paradox.  Or else (these are implications which I would ask the reader always to bear in mind, though it would be too complicated for me to spell them out each time) - or else faith has never existed just because it has always existed.  And Abraham is done for.  That the individual can easily take this paradox for a temptation is true enough.  But one should not keep it quiet on that account.  True enough, too, that many people may have a natural aversion to the paradox, but that is no reason for making faith into something else so that they too can have it; while those who do have faith should be prepared to offer some criterion for distinguishing the paradox from a temptation.  Now the story of Abraham contains just such a teleological suspension of the ethical.  There has been no want of sharp intellects and sound scholars who have found analogies to it.  Their wisdom amounts to the splendid principle that basically everything is the same.  If one looks a little closer I doubt very much whether one will find in the whole world a single analogy, except a later one that proves nothing, for the fact remains that Abraham represents faith, and that faith finds its proper expression in him whose life is not only the most paradoxical conceivable, but so paradoxical that it simply cannot be thought.  He acts on the strength of the absurd; for it is precisely the absurd that as the single individual he is higher than the universal.  This paradox cannot be mediated; for as soon as he tries Abraham will have to admit that he is in a state of temptation, and in that case he will never sacrifice Isaac, or if he has done so he must return repentantly to the universal.  On the strength of the absurd he got Isaac back.  Abraham is therefore at no instant the tragic hero, but something quite different, either a murderer or a man of faith.  The middle-term that saves the tragic hero is something Abraham lacks.  That is why I can understand a tragic hero, but not Abraham, even though in a certain lunatic sense I admire him more than all others.  Abraham’s relation to Isaac, ethically speaking, is quite simply this, that the father should love the son more than himself.  Yet within its own compass the ethical has several rankings; let us see whether this story contains any such higher expression of the ethical which might explain his behaviour ethically, justify him ethically for suspending the ethical duty to the son, yet without thereby exceeding the ethical’s own teleology.  When an enterprise involving a whole nation is prevented, when such an enterprise is brought to a halt by heaven’s disfavour, when divine wrath sends a dead calm which mocks every effort, when the soothsayer performs his sad task and proclaims that the deity demands a young girl as a sacrifice - then it is with heroism that the father has to make that sacrifice.  Nobly will he hide his grief though he could wish he were ‘the lowly man who dares to weep’ and not the king who must bear himself as befits a king.  And however solitarily the pain enters his breast, for he has only three confidants among his people, soon the entire population will be privy to his pain, but also to his deed, to the fact that for the well-being of the whole he was willing to offer that girl, his daughter, this lovely young maiden.  Oh, what bosom! What fair cheeks! What flaxen hair! And the daughter will touch him with her tears, and the father avert his face, but the hero will raise the knife.  And when the news of this reaches the ancestral home all the beauteous maidens of Greece will blush with animation, and were the daughter a bride the betrothed would not be angered but proud to have been party to the father’s deed, because the maiden belonged to him more tenderly than to the father.  When that bold judge, who saved Israel in the hour of need binds God and himself in one breath with the same promise, then it is with heroism that he is to transform the young girl’s jubilation, the beloved daughter’s joy, to sorrow, and all Israel will grieve with her maidenly youth; but every free-born man will understand Jephthah, every stout-hearted woman admire him, and every maiden in Israel will want to do as his daughter; for what good would it be for Jephthah to triumph by making his promise but fail to keep it? Would the victory not be taken once more from the people? When a son forgets his duty, when the State entrusts the father with the sword of judgement, when the laws demand punishment at the father’s hand, then it is with heroism that the father must forget that the guilty one is his son.  Nobly will he hide his pain, but in the nation there will be not one, not even the son, who fails to admire the father, and every time the laws of Rome are interpreted it will be recalled that many interpreted them more learnedly but none more gloriously than Brutus.  On the other hand, if it had been while his fleet was being borne by wind under full sail to its destination that Agamemnon had sent that messenger who brought Iphigenia to the sacrifice; if unbound by any promise that would decide the fate of his people Jephthah had said to his daughter: ‘Sorrow now for two months henceforth over the short day of your youth, for I shall sacrifice you’; if Brutus had had a righteous son and still called upon the lictors to execute him - who would understand them? If to the question, why did you do it?, these three had replied: ‘It is a trial in which we are being tested’, would one then have understood them better? When at the decisive moment Agamemnon, Jephthah, and Brutus heroically overcome their pain, have heroically given up the loved one, and have only the outward deed to perform, then never a noble soul in the world will there be but sheds tears of sympathy for their pain, tears of admiration for their deed.  But if at that decisive moment these three men had added to the heroism with which they bore their pain the little words ‘It won’t happen’, who then would understand them? If in explanation they added: ‘We believe it on the strength of the absurd’, who then would understand them better? For who would not readily understand that it was absurd? But who would understand that for that reason one could believe it? The difference between the tragic hero and Abraham is obvious enough.  The tragic hero stays within the ethical.  He lets an expression of the ethical have its telos in a higher expression of the ethical; he reduces the ethical relation between father and son, or daughter and father, to a sentiment that has its dialectic in its relation to the idea of the ethical life.  Here, then, there can be no question of a teleological suspension of the ethical itself.  With Abraham it is different.  In his action he overstepped the ethical altogether, and had a higher telos outside it, in relation to which he suspended it.  For how could one ever bring Abraham’s action into relationship with the universal? How could any point of contact ever be discovered between what Abraham did and the universal other than that Abraham overstepped it? It is not to save a nation, not to uphold the idea of the State, that Abraham did it, not to appease angry gods.  If there was any question of the deity’s being angry, it could only have been Abraham he was angry with, and Abraham’s whole action stands in no relation to the universal, it is a purely private undertaking.  While, then, the tragic hero is great through his deed’s being an expression of the ethical life, Abraham is great through an act of purely personal virtue.  There is no higher expression of the ethical in Abraham’s life than that the father shall love the son.  The ethical in the sense of the ethical life is quite out of the question.  In so far as the universal was there at all it was latent in Isaac, concealed as it were in his loins, and it would have to cry out with Isaac’s mouth: ‘Don’t do it, you are destroying everything.’ Then why does Abraham do it? For God’s sake, and what is exactly the same, for his own.  He does it for the sake of God because God demands this proof of his faith; he does it for his own sake in order to be able to produce the proof.  The unity here is quite properly expressed in the saying in which this relationship has always been described: it is a trial, a temptation.  A temptation, but what does that mean? What we usually call a temptation is something that keeps a person from carrying out a duty, but here the temptation is the ethical itself which would keep him from doing God’s will.  But then what is the duty? For the duty is precisely the expression of God’s will.  Here we see the need for a new category for understanding Abraham.  Such a relationship to the divine is unknown to paganism.  The tragic hero enters into no private relationship with God, but the ethical is the divine and therefore the paradox in the divine can be mediated in the universal.  Abraham cannot be mediated, which can also be put by saying he cannot speak.  The moment I speak I express the universal, and when I do not no one can understand me.  So the moment Abraham wants to express himself in the universal, he has to say that his situation is one of temptation, for he has no higher expression of the universal that overrides the universal he transgresses.  Thus while Abraham arouses my admiration, he also appals me.  The person who denies himself and sacrifices himself for duty gives up the finite in order to grasp on to the infinite; he is secure enough.  The tragic hero gives up what is certain for what is still more certain, and the eye of the beholder rests confidently upon him.  But the person who gives up the universal to grasp something still higher that is not the universal, what does he do? Can this be anything but temptation? And if it were something else but the individual were mistaken, what salvation is there for him? He suffers all the pain of the tragic hero, he brings all his joy in the world to nothing, he abandons everything, and perhaps the same instant debars himself from that exalted joy so precious to him that he would buy it at any price.  That person the beholder cannot at all understand, nor let his eye rest upon him with confidence.  Perhaps what the believer intends just cannot be done, after all it is unthinkable.  Or if it could be done and the individual had misunderstood the deity, what salvation would there be for him? The tragic hero, he needs tears and he claims them; yes, where was that envious eye so barren as not to weep with Agamemnon, but where was he whose soul was so confused as to presume to weep for Abraham? The tragic hero has done with his deed at a definite moment in time, but in the course of time he achieves something no less important, he seeks out the one whose soul is beset with sorrow, whose breast cannot draw air for its stifled sighs, whose thoughts, weighed down with tears, hang heavy upon him; he appears before him, he breaks the spell of grief, loosens the corset, coaxes forth the tear by making the sufferer forget his own suffering in his.  Abraham one cannot weep over.  One approaches him with a horror religiosus holy terror like that in which Israel approached Mount Sinai.  What if the lonely man who climbs the mountain in Moriah, whose peak soars heaven-high over the plains of Aulis, is not a sleepwalker who treads surefootedly over the abyss, while someone standing at the foot of the mountain, seeing him there, trembles with anxiety and out of respect and fear dares not even shout to him - what if he should be distracted, what if he has made a mistake? - Thanks! And thanks again, to whoever holds out to one who has been assaulted and left naked by life’s sorrows, holds out to him the leaf of the word with which to hide his misery.  Thanks to you, great Shakespeare!, you who can say everything, everything, everything exactly as it is - and yet why was this torment one you never gave voice to? Was it perhaps that you kept it to yourself, like the beloved whose name one still cannot bear the world to mention? For a poet buys this power of words to utter all the grim secrets of others at the cost of a little secret he himself cannot utter, and a poet is not an apostle, he casts devils out only by the power of the devil.  But now when the ethical is thus teleologically suspended, how does the single individual in whom it is suspended exist? He exists as the particular in opposition to the universal.  Does this mean he sins? For this is the form of sin looked at ideally, just as the fact that the child does not sin because it is not conscious of its own existence as such does not mean that, looked at ideally, its existence is not that of sin or that the ethical does not make its demands of the child at every moment.  If this form cannot be said to repeat itself in a way other than that of sin, then judgement has been delivered upon Abraham.  Then how did Abraham exist? He had faith.  That is the paradox that keeps him at the extremity and which he cannot make clear to anyone else, for the paradox is that he puts himself as the single individual in an absolute relation to the absolute.  Is he justified? His justification is, once again, the paradox; for if he is the paradox it is not by virtue of being anything universal, but of being the particular.  How does the single individual assure himself that he is justified? It is a simple enough matter to level the whole of existence down to the idea of the State or to a concept of society.  If one does that one can no doubt also mediate; for in this way one does not come to the paradox at all, to the single individual’s as such being higher than the universal, which I can also put pointedly in a proposition of Pythagoras‘s, that the odd numbers are more perfect than the even.  Should one happen to catch word of an answer in the direction of the paradox in our time, it will no doubt go like this: ‘That’s to be judged by the outcome.’ A hero who has become the scandal of his generation, aware that he is a paradox that cannot be understood, cries undaunted to his contemporaries: ‘The future will show I was right!’ This cry is heard less frequently nowadays, for as our age to its detriment produces no heroes, so it has the advantage that it also produces few caricatures.  Whenever nowadays we hear the words ‘That’s to be judged by the outcome’ we know immediately with whom we have the honour of conversing.  Those who speak thus are a populous tribe which, to give them a common name, I shall call the ‘lecturers’.  They live in their thoughts, secure in life, they have a permanent position and sure prospects in a well-organized State; they are separated by centuries, even millennia, from the convulsions of existence; they have no fear that such things could happen again; what would the police and the newspapers say? Their lifework is to judge the great, to judge them according to the outcome.  Such conduct in respect of greatness betrays a strange mixture of arrogance and pitifulness, arrogance because they feel called to pass judgement, pitifulness because they feel their lives unrelated in even the remotest manner to those of the great.  Surely anyone with a speck of erectior ingenii nobility of mind cannot become so completely the cold and clammy mollusc as to lose sight altogether, in approaching the great, of the fact that ever since the Creation it has been accepted practice for the outcome to come last, and that if one is really to learn something from the great it is precisely the beginning one must attend to.  If anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome, he would never begin.  Even though the result may gladden the whole world, that cannot help the hero; for he knows the result only when the whole thing is over, and that is not how he becomes a hero, but by virtue of the fact that he began.  But in any case the outcome in its dialectic (in so far as it is finitude’s answer to the infinite question) is totally incompatible with the existence of the hero.  Or are we to take it that Abraham was justified in relating himself as the single individual to the universal by the fact that he got Isaac by a marvel? Had Abraham actually sacrificed Isaac, would that have meant he was less justified? But it is the outcome that arouses our curiosity, as with the conclusion of a book; one wants nothing of the fear, the distress, the paradox.  One flirts with the outcome aesthetically; it comes as unexpectedly and yet as effortlessly as a prize in the lottery; and having heard the outcome one is improved.  And yet no robber of temples hard-labouring in chains is so base a criminal as he who plunders the holy in this way, and not even Judas, who sold his master for thirty pieces of silver, is more contemptible than the person who would thus offer greatness for sale.  It goes against my nature to speak inhumanly of greatness, to let its grandeur fade into an indistinct outline at an immense distance, or represent it as great without the human element in it coming to the fore - whence it ceases to be the great; for it is not what happens to me that makes me great, but what I do, and there is surely no one who thinks that anyone became great by winning the big lottery prize.  Even of a person born in humble circumstances I ask that he should not be so inhuman towards himself as to be unable to think of the king’s castle except at a distance and by dreaming of its grandeur indistinctly, wanting to exalt it and simultaneously destroying its grandeur by exalting it in such a debasing way.  I ask that he be human enough to approach and bear himself with confidence and dignity there too.  He should not be so inhuman as shamelessly to want to violate every rule of respect by storming into the king’s salon straight from the street - he loses more by doing that than the king; on the contrary he should find pleasure in observing every rule of decorum with a glad and confident enthusiasm, which is just what will make him frank and open-hearted.  This is only an analogy, for the difference here is only a very imperfect expression of the spiritual distance.  I ask everyone not to think so inhumanly of himself as to dare not set foot in those palaces where not just the memory of the chosen lives on but the chosen themselves.  He should not push himself shamelessly forward and thrust upon them his kinship with them, he should feel happy every time he bows before them, but be frank and confident and always something more than a cleaning woman; for unless he wants to be more than that he will never come in there.  And what will help him are exactly the fear and distress in which the great are tried, for otherwise, at least if there is a drop of red blood in him, they will merely arouse his righteous envy.  And whatever can only be great at a distance, whatever people want to exalt with empty and hollow phrases, that they themselves reduce to nothing.  Was there ever in the world anyone as great as that blessed woman, the mother of God, the Virgin Mary? And yet how do people speak of her? To say she was favoured among women doesn’t make her great, and if it were not for the odd fact that those who listen can think as inhumanly as those who speak, surely every young girl would ask, why am I not favoured too? And had I nothing more to say I should by no means dismiss such a question as stupid; for as regards favours, abstractly considered, everyone is equally entitled.  What is left out is the distress, the fear, the paradox.  My thought is as pure as the next man’s and surely the thought of anyone able to think in this way will be pure; if not, something dreadful is in store; for a person who has once called these images to mind cannot be rid of them again, and if he sins against them, then in their quiet wrath, more terrifying than the clamour of ten voracious critics, they will wreak their awful vengeance on him.  No doubt Mary bore the child miraculously, but it went with Mary ‘after the manner of women’, and such a time is one of fear, distress, and paradox.  No doubt the angel was a ministering spirit, but he was not an obliging one who went round to all the other young girls in Israel and said: ‘Do not despise Mary, something out of the ordinary is happening to her.’ The angel came only to Mary, and no one could understand her.  Yet what woman was done greater indignity than Mary, and isn’t it true here too that those whom God blesses he damns in the same breath? This is the spirit’s understanding of Mary, and she is not at all - as it offends me to say, though even more so that people have mindlessly and irresponsibly thought of her thus - she is not at all the fine lady sitting in her finery and playing with a divine child.  Yet for saying notwithstanding, ‘Behold the handmaid of the Lord’, she is great, and it seems to me that it should not be difficult to explain why she became the mother of God.  She needs no worldly admiration, as little as Abraham needs our tears, for she was no heroine and he no hero, but both of them became greater than that, not by any means by being relieved of the distress, the agony, and the paradox, but because of these.  Great indeed it is when the poet presents his tragic hero for popular admiration and dares to say: ‘Weep for him, for he deserves it’; for there is greatness in meriting the tears of those who deserve to shed them; great indeed for the poet to dare hold the crowd in check, dare discipline people into testing their own worthiness to weep for the hero, for the waste-water of snivellers is a degradation of the holy.  But greater than all these is that the knight of faith dares to say even to the noble person who would weep for him: ‘Do not weep for me, but weep for yourself.’ One is stirred, one harks back to those beautiful times, sweet tender longings lead one to the goal of one’s desire, to see Christ walking about in the promised land.  One forgets the fear, the distress, the paradox.  Was it so easy a matter not to be mistaken? Was it not a fearful thought that this man who walked among the others was God? Was it not terrifying to sit down to eat with him? Was it so easy a matter to become an apostle? But the outcome, eighteen centuries, that helps; it helps that shabby deception wherein one deceives oneself and others.  I do not feel brave enough to wish to be contemporary with such events, but for that reason I do not judge harshly of those who were mistaken, nor think meanly of those who saw the truth.  But now I return to Abraham.  In the time before the outcome either Abraham was a murderer every minute or we stay with the paradox which is higher than all mediation.  So Abraham’s story contains a teleological suspension of the ethical.  He has, as the single individual, become higher than the universal.  This is the paradox which cannot be mediated.  How he got into it is just as inexplicable as how he stayed in it.  If this is not how it is with Abraham, then he is not even a tragic hero but a murderer.  To want to go on calling him the father of faith, to talk of this to those who are only concerned with words, is thoughtless.  A tragic hero can become a human being by his own strength, but not the knight of faith.  When a person sets out on the tragic hero’s admittedly hard path there are many who could lend him advice; but he who walks the narrow path of faith no one can advise, no one understand.  Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is united is passion, 4 and faith is a passion.  Fear and Trembling Table of Contents Title Page Copyright Page Preface Attunement Speech in Praise of Abraham Problemata Preamble from the Heart Problema I Problema II Problema III Epilogue FOR THE BEST IN PAPERBACKS, LOOK FOR THE Fear and Trembling Problema II Is There an Absolute Duty to God? The ethical is the universal and as such, in turn, the divine.  It is therefore correct to say that all duty is ultimately duty to God; but if one cannot say more one says in effect that really I have no duty to God.  The duty becomes duty to God by being referred to God, but I do not enter into relation with God in the duty itself.  Thus it is a duty to love one’s neighbour; it is a duty in so far as it is referred to God; yet it is not God that I come in relation to in the duty but the neighbour I love.  If, in this connection, I then say that it is my duty to love God, I in fact only utter a tautology, in so far as ‘God’ is understood in an altogether abstract sense as the divine: i.e.  the universal, i.e.  duty.  The whole of human existence is in that case entirely self-enclosed, as a sphere, and the ethical is at once the limit and completion.  God becomes an invisible, vanishing point, an impotent thought, and his power is to be found only in the ethical, which fills all existence.  So if it should occur to someone to want to love God in some other sense than that mentioned, he is merely being extravagant and loves a phantom which, if it only had the strength to speak, would say to him: ‘Stay where you belong, I don’t ask for your love.’ If it should occur to someone to want to love God in another way, this love would be suspect, like the love referred to by Rousseau when he talks of a person’s loving the Kaffirs instead of his neighbour.  Now if all this is correct, if there is nothing incommensurable in a human life, but any incommensurability were due only to some chance from which nothing followed so far as existence is looked at in light of the Idea, then Hegel would be right.  But where he is wrong is in talking about faith or in letting Abraham be looked on as its father; for in this latter he has passed sentence both on Abraham and on faith.  In the Hegelian philosophy das Äussere (die Entäusserung) the outer, the externalization is higher than das Innere the inner.  This is often illustrated by an example.  The child is das Innere, the man das Äussere; which is why the child is determined precisely by the outer, and conversely the man as das Äussere by the inner.  Faith, on the contrary, is this paradox, that interiority is higher than exteriority, or to recall again an expression we used above, that the odd number is higher than the even.  In the ethical view of life, then, it is the individual’s task to divest himself of the determinant of interiority and give it an expression in the exterior.  Whenever the individual shrinks from doing so, whenever he wants to stay inside, or slip back into, the inner determinant of feeling, mood, etc., he commits an offence, he is in a state of temptation.  The paradox of faith is this, that there is an interiority that is incommensurable with the exterior, an interiority which, it should be stressed, is not identical with the first that of the child, but is a new interiority.  This must not be overlooked.  Recent philosophy has allowed itself without further ado to substitute the immediate for ‘faith’.  If one does that it is ridiculous to deny that faith has existed through all ages.  Faith in such a case keeps fairly ordinary company, it belongs with feeling, mood, idiosyncrasy, hysteria and the rest.  So far philosophy is right to say one should not stop at that.  But there is nothing to warrant philosophy’s speaking in this manner.  Prior to faith there is a movement of infinity, and only then enters faith, nec opinate unexpectedly, on the strength of the absurd.  This I am very well able to understand, without claiming thereby to have faith.  If faith is no more than what philosophy passes it off as then Socrates himself already went further, much further, rather than the converse, that he didn’t come that far.  He made the movement of infinity intellectually.  His ignorance is the infinite resignation.  That task is in itself a match for human strength, even if people nowadays scorn it; yet it is only when this has been done, only when the individual has exhausted himself in the infinite, that he reaches the point where faith can emerge.  Then faith’s paradox is this, that the single individual is higher than the universal, that the single individual (to recall a theological distinction less in vogue these days) determines his relation to the universal through his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute through his relation to the universal.  The paradox can also be put by saying that there is an absolute duty to God; for in this tie of obligation the individual relates himself absolutely, as the single individual, to the absolute.  When people now say that it is a duty to love God, it is in a sense quite different from the above; for if this duty is absolute the ethical is reduced to the relative.  It doesn’t follow, nevertheless, that the ethical is to be done away with.  Only that it gets a quite different expression, the paradoxical expression, so that, e.g., love of God can cause the knight of faith to give his love of his neighbour the opposite expression to that which is his duty ethically speaking.  Unless this is how it is, faith has no place in existence; and faith is then a temptation, and Abraham is done for, since he gave in to it.  This paradox does not allow of mediation: for it rests precisely on the single individual’s being only the single individual.  As soon as this individual wants to express his absolute duty in the universal, becomes conscious of it in the latter, he knows he is in a state of temptation, and then, even if he otherwise resists the temptation, he does not come to fulfil that so-called absolute duty, and if he does not resist it he sins even if realiter independently of his inclination, wishes, state of mind his act is the one that was his absolute duty.  Thus what could Abraham have done? If he had wanted to say to someone: ‘I love Isaac more than everything in the world, and that’s why it is so hard for me to sacrifice him’, the person would surely have shaken his head and said: ‘Then why sacrifice him?’, or if he was a perceptive fellow perhaps he might even have seen through Abraham, realized that he was betraying feelings which stood in flagrant contradiction with his deed.  In the story of Abraham we find just such a paradox.  Ethically speaking his relation to Isaac is this, that the father is to love the son.  This ethical relationship is reduced to the relative as against the absolute relation to God.  To the question, why?, Abraham has no other answer than that it is a trial and a temptation, which, as remarked above, is what makes it a unity of being for both God’s sake and his own.  These two are also correlative in ordinary usage.  Thus when we see someone do something that doesn’t conform with the universal, we say, ‘He can hardly be doing that for the sake of God’, meaning by this that he did it for his own sake.  The paradox of faith has lost the intermediate term, i.e.  the universal.  On the one hand it contains the expression of extreme egoism (doing this dreadful deed for his own sake) and on the other the expression of the most absolute devotion (doing it for God’s sake).  Faith itself cannot be mediated into the universal, for in that case it would be cancelled.  Faith is this paradox, and the single individual is quite unable to make himself intelligible to anyone.  One might suppose the single individual could make himself understood to another individual who is in the same situation.  Such a view would be unthinkable were it not that nowadays people try in so many ways to sneak their way into greatness.  The one knight of faith simply cannot help the other.  Either the single individual becomes a knight of faith himself by putting on the paradox, or he never becomes one.  Partnership in these regions is quite unthinkable.  If there is any more precise explanation of the idea behind the sacrifice of Isaac, it is one that the individual can only give to himself.  And supposing one could settle, even with some exactitude, in universal terms, how to understand the case of Isaac (which would in any case be the most absurd self-contradiction, namely that the single individual who stands precisely outside the universal be brought in under universal categories, when he is expressly to act as the single individual outside the universal), the individual could still never be assured of the truth of this explanation by others, but only by himself as the single individual.  So even if someone were so cowardly and base as to want to be a knight of faith on someone else’s responsibility, he would never become one; for only the single individual becomes one, as the single individual, and this is the knight’s greatness, as I can well understand without being party to it, since I lack courage; though also his terror, as I can understand even better.  As everyone knows, Luke 14.26 presents a remarkable teaching on the absolute duty to God: ‘If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.’ This is a hard saying, who can bear to hear it? And for that reason it is heard very seldom.  Yet this silence is only a futile evasion.  The student of theology learns, however, that these words occur in the New Testament, and in one or another exegetical aid he finds the information that misein to hate, both here and in some other passages, is used per meiosin by adopting a weaker sense to mean: minus diligo love less, posthabeo give less priority to, non colo show no respect to, nihil facio make nothing of.  The context in which these words occur seems, however, not to corroborate this tasteful explanation.  For in the next verse but one there is a story about someone who plans to erect a tower but first makes some estimate of his capacity to do so, lest he be the object of ridicule later.  The close link between this story and the verse quoted seems to suggest precisely that the words are to be taken in as terrifying a sense as possible in order that everyone should examine his own ability to erect the building.  If this pious and tender-minded exegete, who thinks he can smuggle Christianity into the world by haggling in this way, should succeed in convincing anyone that grammatically, linguistically, and kata analogian by analogy this was the meaning of the passage, then it is to be hoped that in so doing he also manages to convince the same person that Christianity is one of the most miserable things in the world.  For the teaching which in one of its most lyrical outpourings, where the sense of its eternal validity swells up most strongly, has nothing to offer but a sounding phrase that signifies nothing and suggests only that one is to be less kind, less attentive, more indifferent; the teaching which, just as it seems to want to tell us something terrible, ends up in drivel rather than terror — that teaching is certainly not worth standing up for.  The words are terrible, but I feel sure they can be understood without the person who understands them necessarily having the courage to do as they say.  And yet there must be honesty enough to admit what is there, to confess to its greatness even if one lacks the courage oneself.  Anyone who manages that will not exclude himself from a share in the beautiful story, for in a way it contains a kind of comfort for the man who lacks courage to begin building the tower.  But he must be honest and not pass off this lack of courage as humility, since on the contrary it is pride, while the courage of faith is the only humble courage.  One now sees readily that if the passage is to have any sense, it must be understood literally.  It is God who demands absolute love.  Anyone who, in demanding a person’s love, thinks this must be proved by the latter’s becoming lukewarm towards all that was hitherto dear to him, is not simply an egoist but a fool, and anyone demanding such a love would simultaneously sign his own death-warrant in so far as his life is bound up in this love he craves.  A husband requires his wife to leave her father and mother, but were he to regard it as proof of her special love for him that for his sake she became a lukewarm, indolent daughter, etc., then he would be an idiot among idiots.  Had he any notion of what love was, he would want to discover — and should he discover it see in this an assurance that his wife loved him more than any other in the kingdom — that she was perfect in her love as daughter and sister.  So what would be considered a sign of egoism and stupidity in a person, one is supposed with the help of an exegete to regard as a worthy conception of the deity.  But how then hate them? I shall not take up the human love/hate distinction here, not because I have so much against it, since at least it is a passionate distinction, but it is egoistic and so does not fit here.  If I regard the requirement as a paradox, on the other hand, then I understand it, i.e.  understand it in the way one can understand a paradox.  The absolute duty can then lead to what ethics would forbid, but it can by no means make the knight of faith have done with loving.  This is shown by Abraham.  The moment he is ready to sacrifice Isaac, the ethical expression for what he does is this: he hates Isaac.  But if he actually hates Isaac he can be certain that God does not require this of him; for Cain and Abraham are not the same.  Isaac he must love with all his soul.  When God asks for Isaac, Abraham must if possible love him even more, and only then can he sacrifice him; for it is indeed this love of Isaac that in its paradoxical opposition to his love of God makes his act a sacrifice.  But the distress and anguish in the paradox is that, humanly speaking, he is quite incapable of making himself understood.  Only in the moment when his act is in absolute contradiction with his feeling, only then does he sacrifice Isaac, but the reality of his act is that in virtue of which he belongs to the universal, and there he is and remains a murderer.  Furthermore, the passage in Luke must be understood in such a way that one grasps that the knight of faith has no higher expression whatever of the universal (as the ethical) which can save him.  Thus if we imagine the Church were to demand this sacrifice of one of its members, then all we have is a tragic hero.  For qualitatively the idea of the Church is no different from that of the State, inasmuch as the individual can enter it by common mediation, and in so far as the individual has entered the paradox he does not arrive at the idea of the Church; he doesn’t get out of the paradox either, but must find either his blessedness or his damnation inside it.  An ecclesiastical hero expresses the universal in his deed, and no one in the Church, not even his father or mother, etc., will fail to understand him.  But he is not the knight of faith, and has also a different answer from Abraham’s; he doesn’t say it is a trial or a temptation in which he is being tested.  One as a rule refrains from citing texts like the one in Luke.  There is a fear of letting people loose, a fear that the worst will happen once the individual enjoys carrying on like an individual.  Moreover living as the individual is thought to be the easiest thing of all, and it is the universal that people must be coerced into becoming.  I can share neither this fear nor this opinion, and for the same reason.  No person who has learned that to exist as the individual is the most terrifying thing of all will be afraid of saying it is the greatest.  But then he mustn’t say it in a way that makes his words a pitfall for somebody on the loose, but rather in a way that helps that person into the universal, even though his words can make some small allowance for greatness.  The person who dares not mention such passages dares not mention Abraham either, and to think that existing as the individual is an easy enough matter implies a very dubious indirect admission with regard to oneself; for someone who really respects himself and is concerned for his own soul is assured of the fact that a person living under his own supervision in the world at large lives in greater austerity and seclusion than a maiden in her lady’s bower.  That there may be some who need coercion, who if given free rein would riot in selfish pleasure like unbridled beasts, is no doubt true, but one should show precisely by the fact that one knows how to speak with fear and trembling that one is not of their number.  And out of respect for greatness one should indeed speak, lest it be forgotten for fear of the harm which surely won’t arise if one speaks as one who knows it is the great, knows its terrors, and if one doesn’t know these one doesn’t know its greatness either.  Let us then consider more closely the distress and fear in the paradox of faith.  The tragic hero renounces himself in order to express the universal; the knight of faith renounces the universal in order to be the particular.  As mentioned, it all depends on how one is placed.  Someone who believes it is a simple enough matter to be the individual can always be certain that he is not the knight of faith; for stragglers and vagrant geniuses are not men of faith.  Faith’s knight knows on the contrary that it is glorious to belong to the universal.  He knows it is beautiful and benign to be the particular who translates himself into the universal, the one who so to speak makes a clear and elegant edition of himself, as immaculate as possible, and readable for all; he knows it is refreshing to become intelligible to oneself in the universal, so that he understands the universal and everyone who understands him understands the universal through him in turn, and both rejoice in the security of the universal.  He knows it is beautiful to be born as the particular with the universal as his home, his friendly abode, which receives him straightaway with open arms when he wishes to stay there.  But he also knows that higher up there winds a lonely path, narrow and steep; he knows it is terrible to be born in solitude outside the universal, to walk without meeting a single traveller.  He knows very well where he is, and how he is related to men.  Humanly speaking he is insane and cannot make himself understood to anyone.  And yet ‘insane’ is the mildest expression for him.  If he isn’t viewed thus, he is a hypocrite and the higher up the path he climbs, the more dreadful a hypocrite he becomes.  The knight of faith knows it gives inspiration to surrender oneself to the universal, that it takes courage to do so, but also that there is a certain security in it, just because it is for the universal; he knows it is glorious to be understood by every noble mind, and in such a way that even the beholder is thereby ennobled.  This he knows and he feels as though bound, he could wish this was the task he had been set.  Thus surely Abraham must have now and then wished that the task was to love Isaac in a way meet and fitting for a father, as all would understand and as would be remembered for all time; he must have wished his task was to sacrifice Isaac for the universal, so as to inspire fathers to illustrious deeds - and he must have been well nigh horrified by the thought that for him such wishes were merely temptations and must be treated as such; for he knew it was a solitary path he trod, and that he was doing nothing for the universal but only being tested and tried himself.  Or what was it Abraham did for the universal? Let me speak humanly about it, really humanly! It takes him seventy years to get the son of his old age.  What others get soon enough and have long joy of takes him seventy years.  And why? Because he is being tested and tried.  Is that not insanity? But Abraham believed, and only Sarah wavered and got him to take Hagar as his concubine — but for that reason he also had to drive Hagar away.  He gets Isaac and now he is to be tried once again.  He knew it was glorious to express the universal, glorious to live with Isaac.  But this is not the task.  He knew it would have been a kingly deed to sacrifice such a son for the universal, he himself would have found repose in that, and everyone would have ‘reposed’ in their praise of his deed, just as the vowel ‘reposes’ in its quiescent letter; but this is not the task — he is being tried.  That Roman general famous under the name of Cunctator halted the enemy by his delaying tactics, yet what kind of delayer is Abraham by comparison? But he isn’t saving the State.  This is the sum of one hundred and thirty years.  Who can bear it? Should his contemporaries — if they can be called that — not say: ‘There is an eternal procrastinating with Abraham; when he finally gets a son — and that took long enough — he wants to sacrifice him; he must be demented; and if only he could explain why he wanted to do that, but no, it’s always a “trial” ’? Nor could Abraham offer any further explanation, for his life is like a book put under divine seizure and which will never become publici juris public property.  This is what is terrible.  Anyone who doesn’t see this can always be quite certain he is no knight of faith; but anyone who does see it will not deny that the step of even the most tried tragic hero goes like a dance compared with the slow and creeping progress of the knight of faith.  And having seen it and realized he does not have the courage to understand it, he must at least have some idea of the wonderful glory achieved by that knight in becoming God’s confidant, the Lord’s friend, and — to speak really humanly — in addressing God in heaven as ‘Thou’, while even the tragic hero only addresses him in the third person.  The tragic hero is soon finished, his struggle is soon at an end; he makes the infinite movement and is now safe in the universal.  But the knight of faith is kept awake, for he is under constant trial and can turn back in repentance to the universal at any moment, and this possibility can just as well be a temptation as the truth.  Enlightenment as to which is something he can get from no one; otherwise he would be outside the paradox.  The knight of faith has therefore, first and foremost, the passion to concentrate the whole of the ethical that he violates in one single thing; he can be sure that he really loves Isaac with all his soul.  5 If he cannot be that, he is in a state of temptation.  Next, he has the passion to evoke this certainty intact in a twinkling and in as fully valid a way as in the first instance.  If he cannot do this he doesn’t get started, for then he must constantly start again from the beginning.  The tragic hero, too, concentrates in one single thing the ethical that he teleologically violates, but in this thing he has resort to the universal.  The knight of faith has only himself, and it is there the terrible lies.  Most people let their ethical obligations last a day at a time, but then they never reach this passionate concentration, this energetic awareness.  The tragic hero can in a sense be helped by the universal in acquiring these, but the knight of faith is alone about everything.  The tragic hero acts and finds his point of rest in the universal, the knight of faith is kept in constant tension.  Agamemnon gives up his claim to Iphigenia, thereby finds his point of rest in the universal, and now proceeds to give her in sacrifice.  If Agamemnon had not made the movement, if in the decisive moment, instead of a passionate concentration, his soul had been lost in common chatter about his having several daughters, and vielleicht das Ausserordentliche perhaps something extraordinary could happen - then naturally he would not be a hero but a case for charity.  Abraham has the hero’s concentration too, even though in him it is much more difficult since he has no resort at all to the universal, but he makes one movement more through which he concentrates his soul back upon the marvel.  If Abraham hadn’t done that he would only have been an Agamemnon, provided it can be explained how his willingness to sacrifice Isaac can be justified other than by its benefiting the universal.  Whether the individual is now really in a state of temptation or a knight of faith, only the individual can decide.  Still, it is possible on the basis of the paradox to construct certain criteria which even someone not in it can understand.  The true knight of faith is always absolute isolation, the false knight is sectarian.  The latter involves an attempt to leap off the narrow path of the paradox in order to become a tragic hero on the cheap.  The tragic hero expresses the universal and sacrifices himself for it.  The sectarian Master Jackel has instead his private theatre, i.e. several good friends and companions who represent the universal about as well as the public witnesses in The Golden Snuffbox represent justice.  The knight of faith, on the other hand, is the paradox, he is the individual, absolutely nothing but the individual, without connections and complications.  This is the terror that the puny sectarian cannot endure.  Instead of learning from this that he is incapable of greatness and plainly admitting it, something I cannot but approve since it is what I myself do, the poor wretch thinks he will achieve it by joining company with other poor wretches.  But it won’t at all work, no cheating is tolerated in the world of spirit.  A dozen sectarians link arms, they know nothing at all of the lonely temptations in store for the knight of faith and which he dare not shun just because it would be more terrible still were he presumptuously to force his way forward.  The sectarians deafen each other with their clang and clatter, hold dread at bay with their shrieks, and a whooping Sunday-outing like this thinks it is storming heaven, believes it is following the same path as the knight of faith who, in cosmic isolation, hears never a voice but walks alone with his dreadful responsibility.  As for the knight of faith, he is assigned to himself alone, he has the pain of being unable to make himself intelligible to others but feels no vain desire to show others the way.  The pain is the assurance, vain desires are unknown to him, his mind is too serious for that.  The false knight readily betrays himself by this instantly acquired proficiency; he just doesn’t grasp the point that if another individual is to walk the same path he has to be just as much the individual and is therefore in no need of guidance, least of all from one anxious to press his services on others.  Here again, people unable to bear the martyrdom of unintelligibility jump off the path, and choose instead, conveniently enough, the world’s admiration of their proficiency.  The true knight of faith is a witness, never a teacher, and in this lies the deep humanity in him which is more worth than this foolish concern for others’ weal and woe which is honoured under the name of sympathy, but which is really nothing but vanity.  A person who wants only to be a witness confesses thereby that no one, not even the least, needs another person’s sympathy, or is to be put down so another can raise himself up.  But because what he himself won he did not win on the cheap, so neither does he sell it on the cheap; he is not so pitiable as to accept people’s admiration and pay for it with silent contempt; he knows that whatever truly is great is available equally for all.  So either there is an absolute duty to God, and if so then it is the paradox described, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal and as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute - or else faith has never existed because it has existed always; or else Abraham is done for; or else one must explain the passage in Luke 14 in the way that tasteful exegete did, and explain the corresponding passages likewise, and similar ones.  Preface, The Myth of Sisyphus PREFACE F OR ME “The Myth of Sisyphus” marks the beginning of an idea which I was to pursue in The Rebel.  It attempts to resolve the problem of suicide, as The Rebel attempts to resolve that of murder, in both cases without the aid of eternal values which, temporarily perhaps, are absent or distorted in contemporary Europe.  The fundamental subject of “The Myth of Sisyphus” is this: it is legitimate and necessary to wonder whether life has a meaning; therefore it is legitimate to meet the problem of suicide face to face.  The answer, underlying and appearing through the paradoxes which cover it, is this: even if one does not believe in God, suicide is not legitimate.  Written fifteen years ago, in 1940, amid the French and European disaster, this book declares that even within the limits of nihilism it is possible to find the means to proceed beyond nihilism.  In all the books I have written since, I have attempted to pursue this direction.  Although “The Myth of Sisyphus” poses mortal problems, it sums itself up for me as a lucid invitation to live and to create, in the very midst of the desert .

He spent the early years of his life in North Africa, where he worked at various jobs—at the weather bureau, an automobile-accessory firm, a shipping company—to help pay for his courses at the University of Algiers.  He then turned to journalism as a career.  His report on the unhappy state of the Muslims of the Kabylie region aroused the Algerian government to action and brought him public notice.  From 1935 to 1938, he ran the Théâtre de l’Équipe, a theatrical company that produced plays by Malraux, Gide, Synge, Dostoevsky, and others.  During World War II, he was one of the leading writers of the French Resistance and editor of Combat , then an important underground newspaper.  Camus was always very active in the theater, and several of his plays have been published and produced.  His books, including The Stranger, The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom , and The Rebel , as well as his plays, have assured his preeminent position in modern French letters.  In 1957 Camus was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.  His sudden death on January 4, 1960, cut short the career of one of the most important literary figures of the Western world when he was at the very summit of his powers.  Fear and Trembling 1 In olden days people said, ‘What a shame things in the world don’t go in the way the priest preaches.’ But the time may be coming, not least with the help of philosophy, when we shall be able to say, ‘How fortunate that things in the world don’t go in the way the priest preaches, since at least there’s a little meaning to life, but none in his sermon.’ 2 Of course any other interest whatever in which an individual concentrates the whole of life’s reality can, when it proves unrealizable, give rise to the movement of resignation.  But I have chosen falling in love to illustrate the movements because this interest will no doubt be more readily understood and thus it relieves me of the need to make all the introductory comments which would be of direct interest to only a few.  3 This requires passion.  Every movement of infinity occurs with passion, and no reflection can bring about a movement.  That’s the perpetual leap in life which explains the movement, while mediation is a chimera which in Hegel is supposed to explain everything and besides is the only thing he has never tried to explain.  Passion is needed even to make the familiar Socratic distinction between what one does and what one doesn’t understand; naturally even more so in making the genuinely Socratic movement, that of ignorance.  What we lack today is not reflection but passion.  For that reason our age is really in a sense too tenacious of life to die, for dying is one of the most remarkable leaps, and a small verse has always greatly attracted me, because having wished himself all the good and simple things in life in five or six lines previously, the poet ends thus: ‘ein seliger Sprung in die Ewigkeit’ a blessed leap into eternity.  4 Lessing has somewhere made similar remarks from a purely aesthetic point of view.  In the passage in question he actually wants to show that sorrow too can express itself with wit.  To that end he quotes the words spoken on a particular occasion by the unfortunate English king, Edward II.  As contrast he quotes from Diderot: a story of a farmer’s wife and a remark of hers, and then continues: ‘That too was wit, and the wit of a peasant at that: but the situation made it inevitable.  Consequently one mustn’t try to find the excuse for the witty expression of pain and of sorrow in the fact that the person who uttered them was superior, well-educated, intelligent, and witty as well, for the passions make all men again equal ...  the explanation lies in the fact that in the same situation probably everyone would have said the same thing.  The peasant woman’s thought is one a queen might just as well have had, just as what the king said on that occasion could, and no doubt would, have been said by a peasant.’ 5 I will explain once more the difference in the collision as between the tragic hero and the knight of faith.  The tragic hero assures himself that the ethical obligation to his son, daughter, etc. is totally present in him by virtue of the fact that he transforms it into a wish.  Thus Agamemnon can say: this is my proof that I am not violating my paternal obligation, that my duty to Iphigenia is my only wish.  Here, then, wish and duty match one another.  Happy my lot in life if my wish coincides with my duty, and conversely; and most people’s task in life is exactly to stay under their obligation, and by their enthusiasm to transform it into their wish.  The tragic hero renounces what he wishes in order to accomplish his duty.  For the knight of faith, wish and duty are also identical, but the knight of faith is required to give up both.  So when renouncing in resignation what he wishes he finds no repose; for it is after all his duty that he is giving up.  If he stays under his obligation and keeps his wish he will not become the knight of faith; for the absolute duty requires precisely that he give up the duty that is identical with the wish.  The tragic hero acquires a higher expression of duty, but not an absolute duty.  6 These movements and attitudes could also be handled aesthetically.  But I leave it open how far faith and the life of belief in general can be handled in that way.  I will only - since I always like to thank those to whom I owe something - express my gratitude to Lessing for the few hints of a Christian drama to be found in his Hamburgische Dramaturgie.  But he has focused on the purely divine side of that life (the consummated victory), and has therefore despaired.  Perhaps if he had paid more attention to the human side he would have come to a different conclusion.  ( Theologia viatorum wayfarer’s theology.) What he says is undeniably very brief, partly evasive, but as I am always very glad of the chance of Lessing’s company I seize on it immediately.  Lessing was not just one of the most erudite minds Germany has produced; he was not just unusually exact in his learning, so that one can safely rely on him and his autopsy without fear of being tricked by inaccurate and concocted quotations, half-understood phrases taken from unreliable compendia, or of being put off-balance by a foolish advertising of novelties that the ancients have stated far better; he had in addition a most unusual gift for explaining what he himself had understood.  There he stopped.  Nowadays one goes further and explains more than one has understood.  7 According to Aristotle the course of the catastrophe is as follows.  In order to avenge itself, the bride’s family plants a vase from the temple among the bridegroom’s household belongings and he is condemned as a temple-robber.  But this is immaterial, for the question is not whether the family is clever or stupid in the manner of its taking revenge; the family is of only theoretical interest in as much as it impinges on the dialectic of the hero.  Besides, there is fatefulness enough in the fact that, though intending to avoid the danger by not marrying, he plunges right into it, together with the fact that his life comes into twofold contact with the divine, first in the utterance of the augur and second by his being condemned as a temple-robber.  8 Here one might trace the dialectic movements in a different direction.  Heaven predicts a personal misfortune due to the marriage, so he could just as well give up the marriage yet needn’t give up the girl on that account, but live in a romantic relationship with her which was more than satisfactory for the lovers.  This, however, amounts to insulting the girl, for in his love for her he doesn’t express the universal, and it was the task both of the poet and of the ethicist to defend marriage.  On the whole, were poetry to attend to the religious aspect and to the inner feeling of its characters, it would command themes of much greater importance than those it now occupies itself with.  Here is the story poetry is repeatedly giving us: a man is stuck with a girl he once loved, or maybe never really loved because he has now seen another who is the ideal.  A man makes mistakes in life, it was the right street but the wrong house, for on the second floor just over the way lives the ideal — that’s what people consider the proper subject of poetry.  A lover makes a mistake, he saw his loved one by candlelight and thought she had dark hair, but look!, on closer inspection she was blonde - however, the sister, there’s the ideal.  That’s what people think poetry is about.  In my view any such man is an impudent fool who can be unbearable enough in life but should be instantly booed off the stage when he tries to put on airs in poetry.  Only the clash of passion against passion provides a poetic collision, not this rummaging about in the particulars of the same passion.  In the Middle Ages, for example, when a girl has fallen in love and then been convinced that earthly love is a sin and prefers a heavenly love, here we have a poetic collision; and the girl too is poetic, for her life is in the idea.  9 There is still another way of treating this legend.  The merman does not want to seduce Agnete, even though he has seduced many previously.  He is no longer a merman, or is if you will a pitiable merman who has now already for some time been sitting sorrowfully on the sea-bed.  However, he knows (as indeed the legend has it) that he can be saved by an innocent girl’s love.  But he has a bad conscience about girls and dare not approach them.  Then he sees Agnete.  Already, many times, as he lay hidden in the reeds, he has seen her walking along the shore.  Her beauty, her quiet self-possession captivate him; but his soul is filled with sadness, no wild desire rages there.  And when the merman blends his sigh with the whispering of the reeds she turns her ear towards it.  Then she stands still and falls into reverie, more delectable than any woman and yet beautiful as an angel of deliverance, who inspired the merman with confidence.  The merman plucks up courage, he approaches Agnete, he wins her love, he hopes for his deliverance.  But Agnete was no quiet girl, she was in fact very taken with the roaring of the ocean and what pleased her about the sad sighing by the sea was that it made the roar in her breast grow stronger.  She would be off and away, rush wildly out into the infinite with the merman, whom she loves - so she eggs the merman on.  She scorned his humility and now the pride reawakens.  10 Aesthetics sometimes treats a similar theme with its usual captiousness.  The merman is saved through Agnete and all ends in a happy marriage.  A happy marriage! Very handy, to be sure.  On the other hand if ethics is to give the wedding speech I imagine things would go differently.  Aesthetics throws the cloak of love over the merman and so everything is forgotten.  It is also rash enough to suppose that things happen at a wedding as they do at an auction, where everything is sold in the condition it is in when it comes under the hammer.  All it cares for is that the lovers get one another, the rest is of no concern.  If only it could see what happens afterwards! But it hasn’t time for that, straightaway it is in full swing again snapping together another couple.  Aesthetics is the most faithless of all sciences.  Anyone who has truly loved it will in a way become unhappy; while anyone who has never done so is and will remain a pecus ox, or blockhead.  11 Up to this point I have carefully avoided all consideration of the question of sin and its reality.  Everything has been centred on Abraham, and he can still be reached with the categories of immediacy, at least so far as I can understand him.  But once sin makes its appearance ethics comes to grief precisely on the question of repentance.  Repentance is the highest ethical expression but for that very reason the most profound ethical self-contradiction.  12 This is not credited in our serious age, and yet remarkably enough even in the typically flightier and less consistently reflective age of paganism the two representatives of the Greek gnothi sauton know thyself way of thought have, each in his own manner, intimated that if one probes one’s own depths what one uncovers is first and foremost the disposition to evil.  I need hardly remark that I am thinking of Pythagoras and Socrates.  13 If one would rather not use a doubter, a similar figure would do.  An ironist, for example, whose sharp eye has taken radical measure of the ludicrousness of life, who through a secret understanding with the forces of life ascertains what the patient needs.  He knows he commands the power of laughter; should he wish to wield it he would be sure of victory and, what is even better, of his happiness.  He knows some voice is going to raise itself against him, but also that he himself is the stronger; he knows people can still be brought for a moment to appear serious - but also that, privately, they long to laugh with him; he knows that it is still possible to bring a woman for a moment to hold up her fan before her eyes when she speaks, but he also knows that behind the fan she is laughing, he knows the fan is not completely opaque, he knows one can make invisible inscriptions on it, he knows that when a woman strikes at him with the fan it is because she has understood him, he knows infallibly how laughter creeps into a person and dwells there secretly, and how once lodged there it lies in ambush and waits.  Let us suppose such an Aristophanes, such a Voltaire, slightly altered, for he is also of a sympathetic nature, he loves life, loves people, and knows that even if a young, saved generation might benefit from the rebuke of laughter, in his own age for many it would mean rack and ruin.  So he keeps silent and as far as possible forgets to laugh himself.  But does he dare keep silent? Perhaps many will fail to see the difficulty I am referring to.  They will probably consider it admirably high-minded of him to keep silent.  That is not at all what I think.  I believe that if any such person has not the magnanimity to keep silent he is a traitor to life.  So I require this magnanimity of him.  But if he has it he dares to keep silent.  Ethics is a dangerous science and it may well have been out of purely ethical considerations that Aristophanes decided to let laughter pass judgement on his misguided age.  Aesthetic magnanimity cannot help.  Its account has no credit column for the taking of such risks.  If he is silent he must enter the paradox.  - Still another scenario: suppose, for example, someone is in possession of an explanation of a public hero’s life, but one that explains it in a deplorable light, and yet a whole generation rests secure in this hero and has no suspicion of anything of the sort.  14 Which of Socrates’s remarks is to be regarded as the decisive one can be a matter of controversy, since Socrates has been in so many ways poetically volatilized by Plato.  I suggest the following: the death-sentence is announced to him, that instant he dies and fulfils himself in the famous rejoinder that he was surprised to have been condemned with a majority of three votes.  He could have found no more ironic jest in some market-place flippancy or fool’s inanity than in this comment on the death-sentence which condemns him from life itself.  15 In so far as there is any question of an analogy here, the circumstances of the death of Pythagoras provide one.  In his last moments Pythagoras had to consummate the silence he had always maintained, and so he said, ‘It’s better to be killed than to speak.’ cf.  Diogenes, 8th Bk.  § 39.  16 ‘Chai potamou roi apeikadzon ta onta legei hos dis es ton auton potamon ouk embaiis.’ cf.  Plato’s Cratyllus §402, Ast.  3rd B.  Pag.  158.  †cf.  Tennemann Gesch .  d .  Philos.  Ister B.  Pag.  220.  Continued, The Myth of Sisyphus ALSO BY A LBERT C AMUS EXILE AND THE KINGDOM From a variety of masterfully rendered perspectives, these six stories depict people at painful odds with the world around them.  A wife can only surrender to a desert night by betraying her husband.  An artist struggles to honor his own aspirations as well as society’s expectations of him.  A missionary brutally converted to the worship of a tribal fetish is left with but an echo of his identity.  Whether set in North Africa, Paris, or Brazil, the stories in Exile and the Kingdom are probing portraits of spiritual exile and man’s perpetual search for an inner kingdom in which to be reborn.  They display Camus at the height of his powers.  Fiction RESISTANCE, REBELLION, AND DEATH Essays In the speech he gave upon accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957, Albert Camus said that a writer “cannot serve today those who make history; he must serve those who are subject to it.” And in these twenty-three political essays, he demonstrates his commitment to history’s victims, from the fallen maquis of the French Resistance to the casualties of the Cold War.  Resistance, Rebellion and Death displays Camus’s rigorous moral intelligence, addressing issues that range from colonial warfare in Algeria to the social cancer of capital punishment.  But this stirring book is, above all, a reflection on the problem of freedom, and, as such, belongs in the same tradition as the works that gave Camus his reputation as the conscience of our century: The Stranger, The Rebel , and The Myth of Sisyphus .  Nonfiction THE STRANGER Since it was first published in English in 1946, Albert Camus’s first novel, The Stranger , has had a profound impact on millions of readers.  Through this story of an ordinary man who unwittingly gets drawn into a senseless murder on a sundrenched Algerian beach, Camus explored what he termed “the nakedness of man faced with the absurd.” Now, in an illuminating American translation, extraordinary for its exactitude and clarity, the original intent of The Stranger is made more immediate.  This haunting novel has been given a new life for generations to come.  Fiction A HAPPY DEATH In his first novel, A Happy Death , written when he was in his early twenties and retrieved from his private papers following his death in 1960, Albert Camus laid the foundation for the The Stranger , focusing in both works on an Algerian clerk who kills a man in cold blood.  But he also revealed himself to an extent that he never did in his later fiction.  For if A Happy Death is the study of a rule-bound being shattering the fetters of his existence, it is also a remarkably candid portrait of its author as a young man.  As the novel follows the protagonist, Patrice Mersault, to his victim’s house—and then, fleeing, on a journey that takes him through stages of exile, hedonism, privation, and death—it gives us a glimpse into the imagination of one of the great writers of the twentieth century.  For here is the young Camus himself, in love with the sea and sun, enraptured by women yet disdainful of romantic love, and already formulating the philosophy of action and moral responsibility that would make him central to the thought of our time.  Fiction THE REBEL An Essay on Man in Revolt For Albert Camus, the urge to revolt is one of the “essential dimensions” of human nature, manifested in man’s timeless Promethean struggle against the conditions of his existence, as well as the popular uprisings against established orders throughout history.  And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its regicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny.  As old regimes throughout the world collapse, The Rebel resonates as an ardent, eloquent, and supremely rational voice of conscience for our tumultuous times.  Nonfiction THE FIRST MAN Jacques Cormery is a boy who lived a life much like Camus’s own.  Camus summons up the sights, sounds and textures of a childhood circumscribed by poverty, a father’s death yet redeemed by the austere beauty of Algeria, and the boy’s attachment to his nearly deaf-mute mother.  Published thirty-five years after its discovery amid the wreckage of the car accident that killed Camus, The First Man is the brilliant consummation of the life and work of this great novelist.  Fiction THE PLAGUE A gripping tale of unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance profoundly relevant to our times.  In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people.  It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.  Fiction THE FALL Mordant, brilliant, elegantly styled, The Fall is a novel of the conscience of modern man in the face of evil.  In a seedy bar in Amsterdam, Clamence, an expatriate Frenchman, indulges in a calculated confession.  He recalls his past life as a respected Parisian lawyer, a champion of noble causes, and, privately, a libertine—yet one apparently immune to judgment.  As his narrative unfolds, ambiguities amass; every triump reveals a failure, every motive a hidden treachery.  The irony of his recital anticipates his downfall—and implicates us all.

Appendix: Hope and the Absurd in the Work of Franz Kafka, The Myth of Sisyphus APPENDIX: Hope and the Absurd in the Work of Franz Kafka T HE WHOLE ART of Kafka consists in forcing the reader to reread.  His endings, or his absence of endings, suggest explanations which, however, are not revealed in clear language but, before they seem justified, require that the story be reread from another point of view.  Sometimes there is a double possibility of interpretation, whence appears the necessity for two readings.  This is what the author wanted.  But it would be wrong to try to interpret everything in Kafka in detail.  A symbol is always in general and, however precise its translation, an artist can restore to it only its movement: there is no word-for-word rendering.  Moreover, nothing is harder to understand than a symbolic work.  A symbol always transcends the one who makes use of it and makes him say in reality more than he is aware of expressing.  In this regard, the surest means of getting hold of it is not to provoke it, to begin the work without a preconceived attitude and not to look for its hidden currents.  For Kafka in particular it is fair to agree to his rules, to approach the drama through its externals and the novel through its form.  At first glance and for a casual reader, they are disturbing adventures that carry off quaking and dogged characters into pursuit of problems they never formulate.  In The Trial , Joseph K.  is accused.  But he doesn’t know of what.  He is doubtless eager to defend himself, but he doesn’t know why.  The lawyers find his case difficult.  Meanwhile, he does not neglect to love, to eat, or to read his paper.  Then he is judged.  But the courtroom is very dark.  He doesn’t understand much.  He merely assumes that he is condemned, but to what he barely wonders.  At times he suspects just the same, and he continues living.  Some time later two well-dressed and polite gentlemen come to get him and invite him to follow them.  Most courteously they lead him into a wretched suburb, put his head on a stone, and slit his throat.  Before dying the condemned man says merely: “Like a dog.” You see that it is hard to speak of a symbol in a tale whose most obvious quality just happens to be naturalness.  But naturalness is a hard category to understand.  There are works in which the event seems natural to the reader.  But there are others (rarer, to be sure) in which the character considers natural what happens to him.  By an odd but obvious paradox, the more extraordinary the character’s adventures are, the more noticeable will be the naturalness of the story: it is in proportion to the divergence we feel between the strangeness of a man’s life and the simplicity with which that man accepts it.  It seems that this naturalness is Kafka’s.  And, precisely, one is well aware what The Trial means.  People have spoken of an image of the human condition.  To be sure.  Yet it is both simpler and more complex.  I mean that the significance of the novel is more particular and more personal to Kafka.  To a certain degree, he is the one who does the talking, even though it is me he confesses.  He lives and he is condemned.  He learns this on the first pages of the novel he is pursuing in this world, and if he tries to cope with this, he nonetheless does so without surprise.  He will never show sufficient astonishment at this lack of astonishment.  It is by such contradictions that the first signs of the absurd work are recognized.  The mind projects into the concrete its spiritual tragedy.  And it can do so solely by means of a perpetual paradox which confers on colors the power to express the void and on daily gestures the strength to translate eternal ambitions.  Likewise, The Castle is perhaps a theology in action, but it is first of all the individual adventure of a soul in quest of its grace, of a man who asks of this world’s objects their royal secret and of women the signs of the god that sleeps in them.  Metamorphosis , in turn, certainly represents the horrible imagery of an ethic of lucidity.  But it is also the product of that incalculable amazement man feels at being conscious of the beast he becomes effortlessly.  In this fundamental ambiguity lies Kafka’s secret.  These perpetual oscillations between the natural and the extraordinary, the individual and the universal, the tragic and the everyday, the absurd and the logical, are found throughout his work and give it both its resonance and its meaning.  These are the paradoxes that must be enumerated, the contradictions that must be strengthened, in order to understand the absurd work.  A symbol, indeed, assumes two planes, two worlds of ideas and sensations, and a dictionary of correspondences between them.  This lexicon is the hardest thing to draw up.  But awaking to the two worlds brought face to face is tantamount to getting on the trail of their secret relationships.  In Kafka these two worlds are that of everyday life on the one hand and, on the other, that of supernatural anxiety.  *1 It seems that we are witnessing here an interminable exploitation of Nietzsche’s remark: “Great problems are in the street.” There is in the human condition (and this is a commonplace of all literatures) a basic absurdity as well as an implacable nobility.  The two coincide, as is natural.  Both of them are represented, let me repeat, in the ridiculous divorce separating our spiritual excesses and the ephemeral joys of the body.  The absurd thing is that it should be the soul of this body which it transcends so inordinately.  Whoever would like to represent this absurdity must give it life in a series of parallel contrasts.  Thus it is that Kafka expresses tragedy by the everyday and the absurd by the logical.  An actor lends more force to a tragic character the more careful he is not to exaggerate it.  If he is moderate, the horror he inspires will be immoderate.  In this regard Greek tragedy is rich in lessons.  In a tragic work fate always makes itself felt better in the guise of logic and naturalness.  Œdipus’s fate is announced in advance.  It is decided supernaturally that he will commit the murder and the incest.  The drama’s whole effort is to show the logical system which, from deduction to deduction, will crown the hero’s misfortune.  Merely to announce to us that uncommon fate is scarcely horrible, because it is improbable.  But if its necessity is demonstrated to us in the framework of everyday life, society, state, familiar emotion, then the horror is hallowed.  In that revolt that shakes man and makes him say: “That is not possible,” there is an element of desperate certainty that “that” can be.  This is the whole secret of Greek tragedy, or at least of one of its aspects.  For there is another which, by a reverse method, would help us to understand Kafka better.  The human heart has a tiresome tendency to label as fate only what crushes it.  But happiness likewise, in its way, is without reason, since it is inevitable.  Modern man, however, takes the credit for it himself, when he doesn’t fail to recognize it.  Much could be said, on the contrary, about the privileged fates of Greek tragedy and those favored in legend who, like Ulysses, in the midst of the worst adventures are saved from themselves.  It was not so easy to return to Ithaca.  What must be remembered in any case is that secret complicity that joins the logical and the everyday to the tragic.  This is why Samsa, the hero of Metamorphosis , is a traveling salesman.  This is why the only thing that disturbs him in the strange adventure that makes a vermin of him is that his boss will be angry at his absence.  Legs and feelers grow out on him, his spine arches up, white spots appear on his belly and—I shall not say that this does not astonish him, for the effect would be spoiled—but it causes him a “slight annoyance.” The whole art of Kafka is in that distinction.  In his central work, The Castle , the details of everyday life stand out, and yet in that strange novel in which nothing concludes and everything begins over again, it is the essential adventure of a soul in quest of its grace that is represented.  That translation of the problem into action, that coincidence of the general and the particular are recognized likewise in the little artifices that belong to every great creator.  In The Trial the hero might have been named Schmidt or Franz Kafka.  But he is named Joseph K.  He is not Kafka and yet he is Kafka.  He is an average European.  He is like everybody else.  But he is also the entity K.  who is the x of this flesh-and-blood equation.  Likewise, if Kafka wants to express the absurd, he will make use of consistency.  You know the story of the crazy man who was fishing in a bathtub.  A doctor with ideas as to psychiatric treatments asked him “if they were biting,” to which he received the harsh reply: “Of course not, you fool, since this is a bathtub.” That story belongs to the baroque type.  But in it can be grasped quite clearly to what a degree the absurd effect is linked to an excess of logic.  Kafka’s world is in truth an indescribable universe in which man allows himself the tormenting luxury of fishing in a bathtub, knowing that nothing will come of it.  Consequently, I recognize here a work that is absurd in its principles.  As for The Trial , for instance, I can indeed say that it is a complete success.  Flesh wins out.  Nothing is lacking, neither the unexpressed revolt (but it is what is writing), nor lucid and mute despair (but it is what is creating), nor that amazing freedom of manner which the characters of the novel exemplify until their ultimate death.  * * * Yet this world is not so closed as it seems.  Into this universe devoid of progress, Kafka is going to introduce hope in a strange form.  In this regard The Trial and The Castle do not follow the same direction.  They complement each other.  The barely perceptible progression from one to the other represents a tremendous conquest in the realm of evasion.  The Trial propounds a problem which The Castle , to a certain degree, solves.  The first describes according to a quasi-scientific method and without concluding.  The second, to a certain degree, explains.  The Trial diagnoses, and The Castle imagines a treatment.  But the remedy proposed here does not cure.  It merely brings the malady back into normal life.  It helps to accept it.  In a certain sense (let us think of Kierkegaard), it makes people cherish it.  The Land Surveyor K.  cannot imagine another anxiety than the one that is tormenting him.  The very people around him become attached to that void and that nameless pain, as if suffering assumed in this case a privileged aspect.  “How I need you,” Frieda says to K.  “How forsaken I feel, since knowing you, when you are not with me.” This subtle remedy that makes us love what crushes us and makes hope spring up in a world without issue, this sudden “leap” through which everything is changed, is the secret of the existential revolution and of The Castle itself.  Few works are more rigorous in their development than The Castle .  K.  is named Land Surveyor to the Castle and he arrives in the village.  But from the village to the Castle it is impossible to communicate.  For hundreds of pages K.  persists in seeking his way, makes every advance, uses trickery and expedients, never gets angry, and with disconcerting good will tries to assume the duties entrusted to him.  Each chapter is a new frustration.  And also a new beginning.  It is not logic, but consistent method.  The scope of that insistence constitutes the work’s tragic quality.  When K.  telephones to the Castle, he hears confused, mingled voices, vague laughs, distant invitations.  That is enough to feed his hope, like those few signs appearing in summer skies or those evening anticipations which make up our reason for living.  Here is found the secret of the melancholy peculiar to Kafka.  The same, in truth, that is found in Proust’s work or in the landscape of Plotinus: a nostalgia for a lost paradise.  “I become very sad,” says Olga, “when Barnabas tells me in the morning that he is going to the Castle: that probably futile trip, that probably wasted day, that probably empty hope.” “Probably”—on this implication Kafka gambles his entire work.  But nothing avails; the quest of the eternal here is meticulous.  And those inspired automata, Kafka’s characters, provide us with a precise image of what we should be if we were deprived of our distractions *2 and utterly consigned to the humiliations of the divine.  In The Castle that surrender to the everyday becomes an ethic.  The great hope of K.  is to get the Castle to adopt him.  Unable to achieve this alone, his whole effort is to deserve this favor by becoming an inhabitant of the village, by losing the status of foreigner that everyone makes him feel.  What he wants is an occupation, a home, the life of a healthy, normal man.  He can’t stand his madness any longer.  He wants to be reasonable.  He wants to cast off the peculiar curse that makes him a stranger to the village.  The episode of Frieda is significant in this regard.  If he takes as his mistress this woman who has known one of the Castle’s officials, this is because of her past.  He derives from her something that transcends him—while being aware of what makes her forever unworthy of the Castle.  This makes one think of Kierkegaard’s strange love for Regina Olsen.  In certain men, the fire of eternity consuming them is great enough for them to burn in it the very heart of those closest to them.  The fatal mistake that consists in giving to God what is not God’s is likewise the subject of this episode of The Castle .  But for Kafka it seems that this is not a mistake.  It is a doctrine and a “leap.” There is nothing that is not God’s.  Even more significant is the fact that the Land Surveyor breaks with Frieda in order to go toward the Barnabas sisters.  For the Barnabas family is the only one in the village that is utterly forsaken by the Castle and by the village itself.  Amalia, the elder sister, has rejected the shameful propositions made her by one of the Castle’s officials.  The immoral curse that followed has forever cast her out from the love of God.  Being incapable of losing one’s honor for God amounts to making oneself unworthy of his grace.  You recognize a theme familiar to existential philosophy: truth contrary to morality.  At this point things are far-reaching.  For the path pursued by Kafka’s hero from Frieda to the Barnabas sisters is the very one that leads from trusting love to the deification of the absurd.  Here again Kafka’s thought runs parallel to Kierkegaard.  It is not surprising that the “Barnabas story” is placed at the end of the book.  The Land Surveyor’s last attempt is to recapture God through what negates him, to recognize him, not according to our categories of goodness and beauty, but behind the empty and hideous aspects of his indifference, of his injustice, and of his hatred.  That stranger who asks the Castle to adopt him is at the end of his voyage a little more exiled because this time he is unfaithful to himself, forsaking morality, logic, and intellectual truths in order to try to enter, endowed solely with his mad hope, the desert of divine grace.  *3 * * * The word “hope” used here is not ridiculous.  On the contrary, the more tragic the condition described by Kafka, the firmer and more aggressive that hope becomes.  The more truly absurd The Trial is, the more moving and illegitimate the impassioned “leap” of The Castle seems.  But we find here again in a pure state the paradox of existential thought as it is expressed, for instance, by Kierkegaard: “Earthly hope must be killed; only then can one be saved by true hope,” *4 which can be translated: “One has to have written The Trial to undertake The Castle .” Most of those who have spoken of Kafka have indeed defined his work as a desperate cry with no recourse left to man.  But this calls for review.  There is hope and hope.  To me the optimistic work of Henri Bordeaux seems peculiarly discouraging.  This is because it has nothing for the discriminating.  Malraux’s thought, on the other hand, is always bracing.  But in these two cases neither the same hope nor the same despair is at issue.  I see merely that the absurd work itself may lead to the infidelity I want to avoid.  The work which was but an ineffectual repetition of a sterile condition, a lucid glorification of the ephemeral, becomes here a cradle of illusions.  It explains, it gives a shape to hope.  The creator can no longer divorce himself from it.  It is not the tragic game it was to be.  It gives a meaning to the author’s life.  It is strange in any case that works of related inspiration like those of Kafka, Kierkegaard, or Chestov—those, in short, of existential novelists and philosophers completely oriented toward the Absurd and its consequences—should in the long run lead to that tremendous cry of hope.  They embrace the God that consumes them.  It is through humility that hope enters in.  For the absurd of this existence assures them a little more of supernatural reality.  If the course of this life leads to God, there is an outcome after all.  And the perseverance, the insistence with which Kierkegaard, Chestov, and Kafka’s heroes repeat their itineraries are a special warrant of the uplifting power of that certainty.  *5 Kafka refuses his god moral nobility, evidence, virtue, coherence, but only the better to fall into his arms.  The absurd is recognized, accepted, and man is resigned to it, but from then on we know that it has ceased to be the absurd.  Within the limits of the human condition, what greater hope than the hope that allows an escape from that condition? As I see once more, existential thought in this regard (and contrary to current opinion) is steeped in a vast hope.  The very hope which at the time of early Christianity and the spreading of the good news inflamed the ancient world.  But in that leap that characterizes all existential thought, in that insistence, in that surveying of a divinity devoid of surface, how can one fail to see the mark of a lucidity that repudiates itself? It is merely claimed that this is pride abdicating to save itself.  Such a repudiation would be fecund.  But this does not change that.  The moral value of lucidity cannot be diminished in my eyes by calling it sterile like all pride.  For a truth also, by its very definition, is sterile.  All facts are.  In a world where everything is given and nothing is explained, the fecundity of a value or of a metaphysic is a notion devoid of meaning.  In any case, you see here in what tradition of thought Kafka’s work takes its place.  It would indeed be intelligent to consider as inevitable the progression leading from The Trial to The Castle .  Joseph K.  and the Land Surveyor K.  are merely two poles that attract Kafka.  *6 I shall speak like him and say that his work is probably not absurd.  But that should not deter us from seeing its nobility and universality.  They come from the fact that he managed to represent so fully the everyday passage from hope to grief and from desperate wisdom to intentional blindness.  His work is universal (a really absurd work is not universal) to the extent to which it represents the emotionally moving face of man fleeing humanity, deriving from his contradictions reasons for believing, reasons for hoping from his fecund despairs, and calling life his terrifying apprenticeship in death.  It is universal because its inspiration is religious.  As in all religions, man is freed of the weight of his own life.  But if I know that, if I can even admire it, I also know that I am not seeking what is universal, but what is true.  The two may well not coincide.  This particular view will be better understood if I say that truly hopeless thought just happens to be defined by the opposite criteria and that the tragic work might be the work that, after all future hope is exiled, describes the life of a happy man.  The more exciting life is, the more absurd is the idea of losing it.  This is perhaps the secret of that proud aridity felt in Nietzsche’s work.  In this connection, Nietzsche appears to be the only artist to have derived the extreme consequences of an æsthetic of the Absurd, inasmuch as his final message lies in a sterile and conquering lucidity and an obstinate negation of any supernatural consolation.  The preceding should nevertheless suffice to bring out the capital importance of Kafka in the framework of this essay.  Here we are carried to the confines of human thought.  In the fullest sense of the word, it can be said that everything in that work is essential.  In any case, it propounds the absurd problem altogether.  If one wants to compare these conclusions with our initial remarks, the content with the form, the secret meaning of The Castle with the natural art in which it is molded, K.’s passionate, proud quest with the everyday setting against which it takes place, then one will realize what may be its greatness.  For if nostalgia is the mark of the human, perhaps no one has given such flesh and volume to these phantoms of regret.  But at the same time will be sensed what exceptional nobility the absurd work calls for, which is perhaps not found here.  If the nature of art is to bind the general to the particular, ephemeral eternity of a drop of water to the play of its lights, it is even truer to judge the greatness of the absurd writer by the distance he is able to introduce between these two worlds.  His secret consists in being able to find the exact point where they meet in their greatest disproportion.  And, to tell the truth, this geometrical locus of man and the inhuman is seen everywhere by the pure in heart.  If Faust and Don Quixote are eminent creations of art, this is because of the immeasurable nobilities they point out to us with their earthly hands.  Yet a moment always comes when the mind negates the truths that those hands can touch.  A moment comes when the creation ceases to be taken tragically; it is merely taken seriously.  Then man is concerned with hope.  But that is not his business.  His business is to turn away from subterfuge.  Yet this is just what I find at the conclusion of the vehement proceedings Kafka institutes against the whole universe.  His unbelievable verdict is this hideous and upsetting world in which the very moles dare to hope.  *7 *1 It is worth noting that the works of Kafka can quite as legitimately be interpreted in the sense of a social criticism (for instance in The Trial ).  It is probable, moreover, that there is no need to choose.  Both interpretations are good.  In absurd terms, as we have seen, revolt against men is also directed against God: great revolutions are always metaphysical.  *2 In The Castle it seems that “distractions” in the Pascalian sense are represented by the assistants who “distract” K.  from his anxiety.  If Frieda eventually becomes the mistress of one of the assistants, this is because she prefers the stage setting to truth, everyday life to shared anguish.  *3 This is obviously true only of the unfinished version of The Castle that Kafka left us.  But it is doubtful that the writer would have destroyed in the last chapters his novel’s unity of tone.  *4 Purity of heart.  *5 The only character without hope in The Castle is Amalia.  She is the one with whom the Land Surveyor is most violently contrasted.  *6 On the two aspects of Kafka’s thought, compare “In the Penal Colony,” published by the Cahiers du Sud (and in America by Partisan Review —translator’s note): “Guilt ‘of man’ is understood is never doubtful” and a fragment of The Castle (Momus’s report): “The guilt of the Land Surveyor K.  is hard to establish.” *7 What is offered above is obviously an interpretation of Kafka’s work.  But it is only fair to add that nothing prevents its being considered, aside from any interpretation, from a purely æsthetic point of view.  For instance, B.  Groethuysen in his remarkable preface to The Trial limits himself, more wisely than we, to following merely the painful fancies of what he calls, most strikingly, a daydreamer.  It is the fate and perhaps the greatness of that work that it offers everything and confirms nothing.

They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.  If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent of mortals.  According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the profession of highwayman.  I see no contradiction in this.  Opinions differ as to the reasons why he became the futile laborer of the underworld.  To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods.  He stole their secrets.  Ægina, the daughter of Æsopus, was carried off by Jupiter.  The father was shocked by that disappearance and complained to Sisyphus.  He, who knew of the abduction, offered to tell about it on condition that Æsopus would give water to the citadel of Corinth.  To the celestial thunderbolts he preferred the benediction of water.  He was punished for this in the underworld.  Homer tells us also that Sisyphus had put Death in chains.  Pluto could not endure the sight of his deserted, silent empire.  He dispatched the god of war, who liberated Death from the hands of her conqueror.  It is said also that Sisyphus, being near to death, rashly wanted to test his wife’s love.  He ordered her to cast his unburied body into the middle of the public square.  Sisyphus woke up in the underworld.  And there, annoyed by an obedience so contrary to human love, he obtained from Pluto permission to return to earth in order to chastise his wife.  But when he had seen again the face of this world, enjoyed water and sun, warm stones and the sea, he no longer wanted to go back to the infernal darkness.  Recalls, signs of anger, warnings were of no avail.  Many years more he lived facing the curve of the gulf, the sparkling sea, and the smiles of earth.  A decree of the gods was necessary.  Mercury came and seized the impudent man by the collar and, snatching him from his joys, led him forcibly back to the underworld, where his rock was ready for him.  You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero.  He is , as much through his passions as through his torture.  His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing.  This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth.  Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld.  Myths are made for the imagination to breathe life into them.  As for this myth, one sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh start with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands.  At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time without depth, the purpose is achieved.  Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward that lower world whence he will have to push it up again toward the summit.  He goes back down to the plain.  It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me.  A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end.  That hour like a breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the hour of consciousness.  At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate.  He is stronger than his rock.  If this myth is tragic, that is because its hero is conscious.  Where would his torture be, indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding upheld him? The workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd.  But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious.  Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent.  The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory.  There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.  * * * If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy.  This word is not too much.  Again I fancy Sisyphus returning toward his rock, and the sorrow was in the beginning.  When the images of earth cling too tightly to memory, when the call of happiness becomes too insistent, it happens that melancholy rises in man’s heart: this is the rock’s victory, this is the rock itself.  The boundless grief is too heavy to bear.  These are our nights of Gethsemane.  But crushing truths perish from being acknowledged.  Thus, Œdipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing it.  But from the moment he knows, his tragedy begins.  Yet at the same moment, blind and desperate, he realizes that the only bond linking him to the world is the cool hand of a girl.  Then a tremendous remark rings out: “Despite so many ordeals, my advanced age and the nobility of my soul make me conclude that all is well.” Sophocles’ Œdipus, like Dostoevsky’s Kirilov, thus gives the recipe for the absurd victory.  Ancient wisdom confirms modern heroism.  One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of happiness.  “What! by such narrow ways—?” There is but one world, however.  Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth.  They are inseparable.  It would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs from the absurd discovery.  It happens as well that the feeling of the absurd springs from happiness.  “I conclude that all is well,” says Œdipus, and that remark is sacred.  It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man.  It teaches that all is not, has not been, exhausted.  It drives out of this world a god who had come into it with dissatisfaction and a preference for futile sufferings.  It makes of fate a human matter, which must be settled among men.  All Sisyphus’ silent joy is contained therein.  His fate belongs to him.  His rock is his thing.  Likewise, the absurd man, when he contemplates his torment, silences all the idols.  In the universe suddenly restored to its silence, the myriad wondering little voices of the earth rise up.  Unconscious, secret calls, invitations from all the faces, they are the necessary reverse and price of victory.  There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night.  The absurd man says yes and his effort will henceforth be unceasing.  If there is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at least there is but one which he concludes is inevitable and despicable.  For the rest, he knows himself to be the master of his days.  At that subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which becomes his fate, created by him, combined under his memory’s eye and soon sealed by his death.  Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of all that is human, a blind man eager to see who knows that the night has no end, he is still on the go.  The rock is still rolling.  I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one’s burden again.  But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks.  He too concludes that all is well.  This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile.  Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world.  The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart.  One must imagine Sisyphus happy.  Fear and Trembling Problema III Was it Ethically Defensible of Abraham to Conceal his Purpose from Sarah, from Eleazar, from Isaac? The ethical is as such the universal; as the universal it is in turn the disclosed.  Seen as an immediate, no more than sensate and psychic being, the individual is concealed.  So his ethical task is to unwrap himself from this concealment and become disclosed in the universal.  Thus whenever he wants to remain in concealment, he sins and is in a state of temptation, from which he can emerge only by disclosing himself.  We find ourselves again at the same point.  Unless there is a concealment which has its basis in the single individual’s being higher than the universal, then Abraham’s conduct cannot be defended, since he disregarded the intermediate ethical considerations.  If, however, there is such a concealment, then we face the paradox, which cannot be mediated, just because it is based on the single individual’s being, in his particularity, higher than the universal, and it is precisely the universal that is the mediation.  The Hegelian philosophy assumes there is no justified concealment, no justified incommensurability.  It is therefore consistent in its requirement of disclosure, but it isn’t quite fair and square in wanting to regard Abraham as the father of faith and to speak about faith.  For faith is not the first immediacy but a later one.  The first immediacy is the aesthetic, and here the Hegelian philosophy may well be right.  But faith is not the aesthetic, or if it is, then faith has never existed just because it has existed always.  It will be best here to look at the whole matter in a purely aesthetic way and for that purpose embark on an aesthetic inquiry, which I would ask the reader for the time being to enter wholeheartedly into, while I for my part will adapt my presentation accordingly.  The category I would like to examine a little more closely is that of the interesting, a category that especially today (just because we live in discrimine rerum at a turning-point in human affairs) has acquired great importance, for really it is the category of crisis.  Therefore one should not, as sometimes happens, when one has been oneself enamoured of it pro virili with all one’s strength, disdain the category because it has passed one by; but neither should one be too greedy for it, for what is certain is that to become of interest, for one’s life to be interesting, has nothing to do with what you can turn your hand to but is a fateful privilege which, like every privilege in the world of spirit, can only be purchased in deep pain.  Thus Socrates was the most interesting person that has lived, his life the most interesting that has been led, but that existence was allotted to him by the deity, and since he had to work for it he was no stranger to trouble and pain.  Taking such an existence in vain ill-becomes someone who takes life seriously, and yet such attempts are nowadays not infrequently observed.  The category of the interesting is, moreover, a borderline one, it marks the boundary between the aesthetic and the ethical.  For that reason in our inquiry we must be constantly glancing over into the territory of ethics, while to give our inquiries weight the problem must be grasped with genuine aesthetic feeling.  These days ethics rarely considers such things.  The reason is supposed to be that there is no room for them in the System.  But then doing so in monographs should be all right; and besides, if one doesn’t want to be long-winded about it one can achieve the same results by being brief, so long as one has the predicate in one’s power; for a predicate or two can reveal a whole world.  Is there no room in the System for little words like these? Aristotle says in his immortal Poetics: ‘duo men oun tou muthou meri, peri taut’ esti, peripeteia kai anagnorisis’ (cf.  Ch.  II) ’...  indeed two parts in the myth, namely sudden change of fortune the reverse (on which the plot of a tragedy turns) and recognition, concern these things‘.  Naturally only the second feature, anagnorisis, recognition, concerns me here.  Whenever there is recognition there is eo ipso a question of prior concealment.  Just as the recognition is the resolving factor, or the element of relaxation in the life of drama, so is concealment the element of tension.  What Aristotle says earlier in the same chapter in respect of the consequences for the worth of tragedy of the question whether peripeteia and anagnorisis clash, as well as of the ‘single’ and ‘double’ recognition, I cannot go into here, even though the sincerity and quiet absorption of Aristotle’s discussion have an inevitable attraction for one long since tired of the superficial omniscience of the synopticists.  A general observation must suffice.  In Greek tragedy concealment (and therefore recognition) is an epic survival based on a fate in which the dramatic action disappears from view, and from which it acquires its obscure and enigmatic origin.  This is why the effect produced by a Greek tragedy bears a resemblance to the impression given by a marble statue that lacks the power of the eye.  Greek tragedy is blind.  Hence it takes a certain abstraction to appreciate it.  A son murders his father, but not until later learns it is his father.  A sister is about to sacrifice her brother, but at the decisive moment discovers that is who it is.  Tragedy of this nature is less apt to interest our reflective age.  Modern drama has given up the idea of Fate, has in dramatic respects emancipated itself; it observes, it looks in upon itself, takes fate up into its dramatic consciousness.  Concealment and disclosure then become the hero’s free act, for which he is responsible.  Recognition and concealment are also an essential part of modern drama.  It would take us too far to give examples.  I am courteous enough to assume that everyone in this so aesthetically voluptuous age, so potent and aroused that conception occurs as easily as with the partridge which, Aristotle says, needs only to hear the voice of the cock or its flight overhead — to assume that at the mere sound of the word ‘concealment’ everyone can easily shake a dozen romances and comedies from his sleeve.  I can therefore be brief and offer straightaway a fairly broad observation.  If the person doing the hiding, i.e.  the one who puts the dramatic yeast into the play, hides something nonsensical, we have comedy.  But if the concealer is related to the idea, he may come close to being a tragic hero.  To give just one example of the comic.  A man puts on make-up and wears a wig.  The same man wants to have success with the fair sex, and is sure enough of conquests with the help of the make-up and wig, which there is no doubt make him irresistible.  He captures a girl and is on the pinnacle of joy.  But now for the point.  If he can admit his deception, will he not lose all of his powers of fascination once he is revealed as a quite ordinary, in fact even bald-headed male? Doesn’t he have to lose the loved one again? Concealment is his free action, for which aesthetics holds him responsible.  But that discipline is no friend of bald hypocrites, and will leave him to the mercy of our laughter.  Let that suffice as a hint of what I mean, since we cannot include comedy in the terms of this investigation.  My procedure here must be to let concealment pass dialectically between aesthetics and ethics, for the point is to show how absolutely different the paradox and aesthetic concealment are from one another.  A few examples.  A girl is secretly in love, though neither party has openly confessed its love to the other.  Her parents force her to marry another (she may even be motivated out of considerations of duty).  She obeys.  She hides her love ‘so as not to make the other unhappy, and no one will ever know what she suffers’.  — Or a young lad is in a position, just by dropping one word, to possess the object of his craving and restless dreams.  But that little word will compromise, yes, even, who knows, ruin an entire family.  He nobly chooses to stay in concealment, ‘the girl must never know, so that she can perhaps find happiness with another’.  What a pity that these two, both concealed from their respective loved ones, are also concealed from one another! For otherwise a remarkable higher unity might have been brought about.  — Their concealment is a free act, for which even aesthetically they are responsible.  However, aesthetics is a respectful and sentimental discipline which knows more ways of fixing things than any assistant house-manager.  So what does it do? It does everything possible for the lovers.  By means of a coincidence the respective partners in the projected marriages get wind of the other party’s noble decision.  Explanations follow.  They get each other and as a bonus the rank of real heroes as well; for notwithstanding they have had no time even to sleep on their heroic resolutions, aesthetics sees it as if they had bravely fought for their goal over many years.  For aesthetics doesn’t bother much about time; it goes just as quickly whether in jest or earnest.  But ethics knows nothing either of this coincidence or this sentimentality.  Nor does it have such a rapid concept of time.  Thus the matter acquires a different complexion.  You can’t argue with ethics, because it uses pure categories.  It doesn’t appeal to experience, which of all laughable things is perhaps the most laughable and, far from making a man wise, if he knows nothing higher it will sooner make him mad.  Ethics has no coincidence, so no explanations follow; it doesn’t flirt with thoughts of dignity, it puts an enormous burden of responsibility on the hero’s frail shoulders; it condemns as presumptuous his thought of wanting to play providence in his action, but also condemns him for wanting to do likewise with his suffering.  It enjoins the belief in reality and the courage to contend with all its tribulations, rather than with those bloodless sufferings he has taken on himself by his own responsibility; it warns against putting faith in the calculating shrewdness of reason, more treacherous than the oracles of the ancients.  It warns against all misplaced magnanimity.  Let reality decide the occasion, that is the time to show courage.  But then ethics, too, will offer every possible assistance.  If something deeper had been stirring in those two, however, if there had been a seriousness to see the task, to set about it, then no doubt something would have come of them.  But ethics cannot help them.  Ethics is offended because they are keeping a secret from it, a secret they have incurred on their own responsibility.  Thus aesthetics called for concealment and rewarded it.  Ethics called for disclosure and punished concealment.  Sometimes, however, even aesthetics calls for disclosure.  When the hero held captive in the aesthetic illusion believes he can save another by his silence, aesthetics calls for silence and rewards it.  But when the hero’s action involves interfering in another person’s life, it calls for disclosure.  Now I am talking of the tragic hero.  Consider for a moment Euripides’s Iphigenia in Aulis.  Agamemnon is about to sacrifice Iphigenia.  Now aesthetics calls for Agamemnon’s silence, in so far as it would be unworthy of the hero to seek another’s consolation, just as he should keep it quiet as long as possible for the women’s sake.  On the other hand the hero, to be that, has also to be tested in the terrible temptation incurred by the tears of Clytemnestra and Iphigenia.  What does aesthetics do? It has a way out; it has an old servant standing by who discloses everything to Clytemnestra.  And now everything is as it should be.  Ethics, however, has no coincidence, and no old servant standing by.  The aesthetic idea contradicts itself as soon as it is applied in reality.  Ethics therefore demands disclosure.  The tragic hero demonstrates exactly this ethical courage by, not himself being captive to the aesthetic illusion, taking it upon himself to tell Iphigenia her fate.  In this the tragic hero is the beloved son of ethics, in whom she is well pleased.  If he remains silent, it may be because by doing so he makes it easier for others, or it could also be because it makes it easier for himself.  But the tragic hero knows he is free of the latter incentive.  In keeping silent here he would be assuming responsibility as an individual, inasmuch as he is impervious to any argument from outside.  But this, as tragic hero, he cannot do; for it is just in so far as he continues to express the universal that ethics loves him.  His heroic action requires courage, but part of that courage is that he shirks no argument.  Now tears, certainly, are a terrible argumentum ad hominem, and there are no doubt those whom nothing else touches but who can still be stirred by tears.  The play lets Iphigenia weep, in fact like Jephthah’s daughter she should have been allowed two months to weep, not in solitude but at her father’s feet, to use all her art ‘which is but tears’, and twine herself instead of the olive branch about his knees (cf.  v.  1224).  Aesthetics required disclosure but availed itself of a coincidence; ethics required disclosure and found satisfaction in the tragic hero.  For all the strictness of the ethical requirement of disclosure, it cannot be denied that secrecy and silence, as determinants of inner feeling, really make for greatness in a man.  When Amor leaves Psyche he says to her, ‘You will give birth to a child who will be divine if you say nothing, but human if you betray the secret.’ The tragic hero, the darling of ethics, is a purely human being, and he is someone I can understand, someone all of whose undertakings are in the open.  If I go further I always run up against the paradox, the divine and the demonic; for silence is both of these.  It is the demon’s lure, and the more silent one keeps the more terrible the demon becomes; but silence is also divinity’s communion with the individual.  Before coming back to the story of Abraham, however, I would like to present some poetic personages.  By exercising the power of dialectic over them I shall keep them at extremes, and by waving the scourge of despair over them I should prevent them from standing still, so that in their anguish they might perhaps bring something or other to light.  6 Aristotle tells in his Politics of a political disturbance in Delphi, arising from a marriage.  The bridegroom, for whom the augurs had predicted a misfortune as a result of his forthcoming marriage, at the crucial moment, when he is to fetch the bride, suddenly changes his plans — he won’t go through with the wedding.  That is all I need.  7 In Delphi this surely did not pass off without tears.  If a poet took it up he could doubtless count on arousing sympathy.  Is it not terrible that the love so often excluded in life should here also be deprived of the aid of heaven? Isn’t the old proverb that marriages are made in heaven here put to shame? Usually it is the trials and tribulations of finitude which, like evil spirits, would separate the lovers, while love itself has heaven on its side and this holy alliance overwhelms all foes.  Here it is heaven itself that separates what heaven, after all, has joined together.  Who would have guessed? The young bride least of all.  A moment earlier she was sitting in her room in all her beauty, and the sweet young maids had adorned her with such care that they would be prepared to justify their handiwork before the whole world, that it gave them more than happiness, it even made them envious - yes, even happy that they couldn’t be even more envious, since she could not have been more beautiful.  Sitting there alone in her room she was then transfigured from one beauty to another; for all that a woman’s art could accomplish had been turned virtuously to the embellishment of virtue.  But there still lacked something the young girl had not dreamed of, a veil, finer, lighter, and yet more concealing than the one in which the young maids had enveloped her, a bridal gown no maid had knowledge of or could help her with, even the bride herself did not know how to put it on.  It was an unseen, friendly influence which takes satisfaction in adorning a bride and wraps itself around her without her knowledge, for all she saw was the bridegroom walking by on his way to the temple.  She saw the door close after him, and she became even more calm and blissful, for she knew that he now belonged to her more than ever.  The temple door opened, he stepped out, but demurely she turned her gaze down and so did not see that his face was troubled.  Yet he saw that heaven must be jealous of the bride’s loveliness and of his good fortune.  The temple door opened, the young maids saw the bridegroom step out, but they did not see that his face was troubled, for they were busy about bringing the bride.  Then she came forward in all her maidenly modesty, and yet like a mistress surrounded by her cortege of young maids of honour, who curtsied before her as a young maid always curtsies before a bride.  Thus at the head of her lovely troupe she stood and waited — it was but a moment, for the temple was close by — and the bridegroom came, but he passed by her door.  But here I break off.  I am not a poet, I only practise dialectics.  One should note first of all that it is at the crucial moment that the hero learns what is in store, so he is pure and blameless, hasn’t bound himself irresponsibly to the loved one.  Second, it is a divine utterance he has before him, or rather against him, so he is not ruled like those feeble lovers and sweethearts by conceit.  Further, it goes without saying that this utterance makes him just as unhappy as the bride, indeed rather more so since after all he is the occasion.  True, the augurs only predicted a misfortune for him, but the question is whether the misfortune is not of such a nature as to affect also their marital happiness.  So what is he to do? (I) Is he to remain silent and get married and think ‘Perhaps the misfortune won’t come right away, and anyway I have been true to my love and not afraid to make myself unhappy; but I must remain silent, otherwise even the brief moment is lost.’ This sounds plausible but is in fact by no means so, for in this he insults the girl.  By keeping silent he has in a way made her guilty, for had she known the truth she would never have given her consent to such a union.  So in the hour of need he will have to bear not only the misfortune but also the responsibility for not having said anything, as well as her righteous anger at his not having said anything.  (2) Is he to remain silent and not get married? In that case he must enter into a deception in which he annihilates himself in his relation to her.  Aesthetics might approve of this.  The catastrophe could then be fashioned as in the real story except that at the last moment there would be explanations, though too late since aesthetically it will be necessary to let him die, unless that discipline can see its way to revoking the fateful prophecy.  Yet, noble as this conduct may be, it involves an insult to the girl and the reality of her love.  (3) Is he to speak? Naturally one mustn’t forget that our hero is a little too poetic for the giving up of his love to have no importance except as an unsuccessful business venture.  If he speaks, then the whole thing becomes an unfortunate love-story in the vein of Axel and Valborg.  They will be a couple whom heaven itself puts asunder.  Nevertheless in the present case this separation is to be conceived somewhat differently, since it, too, is also the result of the free acts of the individuals.  For what is so very difficult with the dialectic in this case is that the misfortune is to affect only him.  These two, then, do not find a common expression of their suffering, as do Axel and Valborg, whom heaven separates equally from each other because they are equally close to each other.  8 If that were the case here, a way out could be found.  For since heaven uses no visible power to separate them, but leaves it to them, one could well imagine that they ended united in defiance of heaven together with its misfortune.  Ethics, however, will require him to speak.  The essence of his valour in that case is to be found in his giving up his aesthetic high-mindedness, which here could hardly be thought to contain any admixture of the vanity connected with concealment, since it must be clear to him that he still makes the girl unhappy.  The reality of this heroism is based, however, on its having had and cancelled its presupposition that he genuinely loved her and kept quiet for her sake and not his — translator’s addition; for otherwise we would get heroes enough, particularly in our own time which has acquired a matchless proficiency in the forgery that does the highest by skipping over what lies in between.  But why this sketch if I nevertheless come no further than the tragic hero? Because it might still throw light on the paradox.  That all depends on our hero’s relationship to that utterance of the augur’s, which in one way or another is going to decide the course of his life.  Is this utterance publici juris public property or is it a privatissimum private matter? The scene is laid in Greece; an augur’s utterance is intelligible to all — I don’t mean just in the sense that the individual can grasp the content lexically, but that the individual can understand that what an augur is conveying to him is a decision of heaven’s.  So the augur’s utterance is intelligible not just to the hero but to everyone and results in no private relation to the divine.  Turn where he will, what was prophesied will happen, and neither by doing anything nor by refraining from doing anything will he come into a closer relationship with the divine, become an object either of divine mercy or of divine wrath.  The outcome will be as understandable to anyone as to the hero, and there is no secret writing that only the hero can read.  So should he want to speak he can perfectly well do so, for he can make himself understood; and if he wants to remain silent it is because he wants, by virtue of being the single individual, to be higher than the universal, wants to delude himself with all manner of phantasies about how she will soon forget this sorrow, etc.  On the other hand, if the will of heaven had not been announced to him by an augur, if it had been made known to him in some quite private way, if it had placed itself in a quite private relationship to him, then we are with the paradox - supposing there is such a thing (since my reflections here have the form of a dilemma) — then he could not speak however much he might wish to.  He would not enjoy his own silence but suffer the pain, yet for him just this would be the assurance he needed that he did right.  So the reason for his silence would not be a wish to place himself as the single individual in an absolute relation to the universal, but to be placed as the single individual in an absolute relationship to the absolute.  In this, so far as I can tell, he would also be able to find repose, whereas the requirements of the ethical would be constantly disturbing his high-minded silence.  One only wishes that aesthetics might try to start where for so many years it has ended, with the illusion of high-mindedness.  As soon as it did so it would work hand in hand with religion, for that is the only power capable of rescuing the aesthetic from its conflict with the ethical.  Queen Elizabeth sacrifices to the State her love for Essex by signing his death-warrant.  That was a deed of heroism, even if some private resentment had a hand in it because he hadn’t sent her the ring.  We know that he did send it, but it was held back through the malice of some lady-in-waiting.  Elizabeth is said, ni fallor if I am not mistaken, to have been informed of this, and sat for ten days with one finger in her mouth, biting it without saying a word, and then she died.  That would be something for a poet who knew how to wrench open the mouth; otherwise it would be of use at best to a ballet master, with whom nowadays the poet no doubt too often confuses himself.  I now want to follow this by a sketch along the lines of the demonic.  For this I shall use the legend of Agnete and the Merman.  The merman is a seducer who rises up from concealment in the depths, and in wild desire grasps and breaks the innocent flower standing in all its charm by the shore, pensively bending its head to the ocean’s roar.  That is what the poets have so far made of it.  Let us make a change.  The merman was a seducer.  He has called out to Agnete, with his smooth talk has coaxed from her her secret thoughts.  She has found in the merman what she was seeking, what she gazed down to find in the depths of the sea.  Agnete is willing to follow him down.  The merman has taken her into his arms, Agnete twines hers about his neck trustingly and with all her soul she abandons herself to the stronger one.  He is already at the sea-edge, bending over the water to dive down with his prey.  Then Agnete looks at him again, not fearfully, not questioningly, not proud of her good luck, not intoxicated with desire, but in absolute faith, with absolute humility, like the humble flower she deemed herself to be; with absolute confidence she entrusts to him her entire fate.  — And look! The ocean roars no more, its wild voice is stilled, nature’s passion - which is the merman’s strength — deserts him, the sea becomes dead calm.  And still Agnete is looking at him in this way.  Then the merman collapses, he is unable to resist the power of innocence, his element becomes unfaithful to him, he cannot seduce Agnete.  He leads her home again, he explains to her that he only wanted to show her how beautiful the sea is when it is calm, and Agnete believes him.  Then he turns back alone, and the ocean rages, but more wildly still rages the merman’s despair.  He can seduce Agnete, he can seduce hundreds of Agnetes, he can charm any girl — but Agnete has triumphed and the merman has lost her.  Only as his prize can she become his; he cannot belong faithfully to any girl, for he is only a merman.  I have allowed myself a slight modification 9 in the merman.  In fact I have slightly altered Agnete too.  In the legend Agnete is by no means guiltless — and in general it is nonsense and sheer coquetry as well as an insult to the female sex to imagine a seduction where the girl is in no way, in no way at all, to blame.  In the legend Agnete is, to modernize my expression somewhat, a woman who hankers for ‘the interesting’, and one such can always be certain there is a merman in the offing; for mermen keep a weather-eye open for the likes of these and they make for them like a shark for its prey.  It is therefore very foolish to suppose (or is it a rumour spread abroad by the merman?) that so-called refinement protects a girl from seduction.  No, life is more just and fair; there is only one means of protection, it is innocence.  We will now give the merman a human consciousness, and let his being a merman indicate a human pre-existence in the consequences of which his life has become entangled.  There is nothing to prevent his being a hero; for the step he now takes is reconciliatory.  He is saved by Agnete, the seducer is crushed, he has bowed to the power of innocence, he can never seduce again.  But immediately two powers claim control of him: repentance alone and repentance with Agnete.  If repentance alone takes possession of him he remains concealed, if repentance and Agnete take possession of him he is disclosed.  And the sea roars and the waves foam, and the merman embraces Agnete, and dives with her into the depths.  Never had he been so wild, never so full of desire; for with this girl he had hoped for his deliverance.  Before long he became tired of Agnete, but her body was never found: for she became a mermaid, who tempted men with her songs.  Now in so far as repentance alone grips the merman and he remains concealed, then he must certainly make Agnete unhappy; for Agnete loved him in all her innocence, she believed him that moment when even to her he seemed changed, however well he concealed it, and said he only wanted to show her the beautiful calm of the sea.  However, as far as passion is concerned, the merman himself becomes even more unhappy; for he loved Agnete with a multiplicity of passions and has a new guilt to bear besides.  The demonic side of repentance will now no doubt explain to him that this is precisely his punishment, and the more it torments him the better.  If he gives in to this demonic possibility, he may make one more attempt to save Agnete, in the way one can in a sense save someone by resort to evil.  He knows Agnete loves him.  If he can only tear this love away from her she will in a way be saved.  But how to do that? The merman has too much sense to reckon that a candid confession will arouse her disgust.  Then perhaps he will try to arouse all dark passions in her, scorn her, mock her, hold her love up to ridicule, if possible stir up her pride.  He will spare himself no torment, for this is the deep contradiction in the demonic and in a sense there dwells infinitely more good in a demonic than in a superficial person.  The more selfish Agnete is, the more easily she will be deceived (only those with very little experience think it easy to deceive innocence, life is very profound and it is the astute who find it easiest to trick one another), but all the more terribly the merman will suffer.  The more ingeniously contrived his deception the less will Agnete bashfully hide her own pain from him; she will use every means, not without effect, not, that is, to shake him loose but to torment him.  By means of the demonic the merman would thus aspire to be the single individual who as the particular is higher than the universal.  The demonic has that same property as the divine, that the individual can enter into an absolute relationship to it.  This is the analogue, the counterpart to the paradox we are discussing.  It therefore bears a certain resemblance to it that can prove misleading.  Thus the merman apparently has the proof of the justification of his silence that it is because of it that he suffers all his pain.  However, there is no doubt that he can speak.  So he can be a tragic hero, to my mind a tragic hero on the grand scale, if he does speak.  Perhaps only few will understand what the grandeur consists in.  10 He will then have the courage to free himself of all self-deception about being able to make Agnete happy by his art; he will have the courage to crush Agnete, humanly speaking.  Here I will just add a psychological observation.  The more selfish we make Agnete, the more effective the self-deception will be, indeed it is not inconceivable that with his demonic astuteness a merman might in reality not only have, humanly speaking, saved Agnete but brought something exceptional out of her.  A demon knows how to torture powers out of even the weakest person, and in his way he can have the best intentions towards a human being.  The merman stands at a dialectical extremity.  If he is saved from the demonic side of repentance two paths are possible.  He can hold himself back, remain in hiding, but not depend on his astuteness.  In that case he does not come as the single individual into an absolute relation to the demonic, but finds repose in the counter-paradox that the divine will save Agnete.  (This is how the movement would have been made in the Middle Ages, for on its conception the merman has obviously dedicated himself to the monastery.) Or else he can be saved through Agnete.  Now this must not be understood as meaning that Agnete’s love might save him from being a seducer in the future (that is an aesthetic rescue attempt, which always avoids the main issue, namely the continuity in the merman’s life); in that respect he is already saved.  He will be saved in so far as he is disclosed.  So he marries Agnete.  But he must still resort to the paradox.  For when through his own guilt the individual has come out of the universal, he can only return to it on the strength of having come, as the particular, into an absolute relation to the absolute.  Here I will insert a comment which takes us further than anything that has been said anywhere in the foregoing.  11 Sin is not the first immediacy, sin is a later immediacy.  In sin the individual is already in terms of the demonic paradox higher than the universal, because it is a contradiction on the part of the universal to want to impose itself on someone who lacks the conditio sine qua non the necessary condition.  Should philosophy, amongst its other conceits, imagine that someone might actually want to follow its precepts in practice, a curious comedy would emerge.  An ethics that ignores sin is an altogether futile discipline, but once it postulates sin it has eo ipso thereby gone beyond itself.  Philosophy tells us that the immediate is to be superseded ophœvet, German aufgehoben .  True enough, but what is not true is that sin, any more than faith, is without further ado the immediate.  Everything goes smoothly so long as I move in these spheres, but in fact not even what is said here helps to explain Abraham.  He did not become the single individual through sin; on the contrary he was that righteous man who is God’s chosen.  So any analogy with Abraham will only surface after the individual has become capable of accomplishing the universal, and now the paradox is repeated.  I can therefore understand the movements of the merman, but I cannot understand Abraham.  It is to realize the universal that the merman has recourse to the paradox.  If he stays hidden and dedicates himself to all the torments of repentance, he becomes a demon, and as such is brought to nothing.  If he stays hidden but entertains no clever thoughts about being able to extricate Agnete at the cost of his own torment in the bondage of repentance, he will no doubt find peace but is lost to the world.  If he discloses himself, lets himself be saved through Agnete, then he is the greatest human being I can imagine.  It is only aesthetics which irresponsibly thinks it can praise the power of love by letting the lost man be loved by an innocent girl and saved thereby.  Only aesthetics mistakes what it sees and thinks the girl rather than the merman is the hero.  So the merman cannot belong to Agnete before, after making the infinite movement of repentance, he has made one more movement, that on the strength of the absurd.  His own strength suffices for the movement of repentance, but it calls for absolutely all his energies, and it is therefore impossible for him by his own strength to return and grasp reality.  If one lacks sufficient passion to make either movement, when one scrimps through life, repenting a little and thinking the rest will take care of itself, one has given up living in the idea once and for all, and then it is very easy to reach, and help others reach, the highest; i.e.  delude oneself and others with the notion that the world of spirit is like Gnavspil a card game, where everyone cheats.  So one can amuse oneself by reflecting how strange it is that just in an age when everyone can reach the highest there should be such widespread doubt about the immortality of the soul; since even someone who has only, but genuinely, made the movement of infinity can scarcely be called a doubter.  The conclusions of passion are the only reliable, i.e.  the only convincing, ones.  Fortunately life is in this case more kindly, more faithful, than the wise would have it.  It excludes no one, not even the humblest; it tricks nobody, for in the world of spirit the only people who are tricked are those who trick themselves.  It is the general opinion, and as far as I dare be my own judge, also my own, that entering the monastery is not the highest.  But I by no means believe on that account that the fact that nobody goes into monasteries today means that we are all greater than those profound and earnest souls who found repose there.  How many people are there now with the passion to think this thought and then judge themselves honestly? The very idea of thus taking time on one’s conscience, of giving conscience time to search out with its sleepless perseverance every secret thought, so that unless one is making the movement every instant on the strength of what is noblest and most holy in a human being one can discover with anguish and horror, 12 and call forth by anguish itself if by nothing else, the dark passions which after all lie concealed in every human life, whereas living in society with others one so easily forgets, so easily avoids, is in so many ways held above all this, gets the chance to start again - this very idea, grasped with decent respect, I would have thought could in itself chasten many an individual in this age of ours which thinks it has already reached the highest.  Yet such things worry people little in this age that thinks it has reached the heights, though no age has fallen so much victim to the comic than ours.  Indeed it is hard to grasp why it hasn’t already given birth, by a generatio cequivoca spontaneous generation, to its hero, that demon who will stage without scruple that horrifying play that reduces the whole age to laughter and to unconsciousness of the fact that it is laughing at itself.  Indeed what more is life worth than to be laughed at when people have already reached the highest by the time they are twenty? And yet what higher movement has the age come up with since people gave up entering monasteries? Is it not a contemptible worldliness, a circumspection and pusillanimity that sits at the head of the table, cravenly making people think they have reached the highest, and even slyly dissuading them from trying anything less? A person who has made the monastery movement has only one movement to go, that of the absurd.  How many nowadays understand what the absurd is, how many live in such a way as to have renounced or gained everything, how many are even simply honest enough to know what they are and what they can and cannot do? And is it not true that if there are such, they are mostly to be found among the less educated and in part among women? Just as a demonic person always reveals himself without understanding himself, our age betrays its own defects in a kind of clairvoyance, for it is always calling for the comical.  If that was really what it needed then perhaps the theatre would need a new play in which someone’s dying for love was treated as comedy.  Or would it not be better for our age if that were really to happen, if it were actually to witness such an occurrence, so that it might acquire the courage to believe in the power of spirit, the courage to stop abjectly stifling its better impulses, stop jealously stifling them in others - with laughter? Does the age really need a ridiculous Erscheinung appearance, show of an enthusiast in order to have something to laugh at? Or does it not rather need such an enthusiastic figure in reality to remind it of what it has forgotten? If one wants a scenario along similar lines but more moving because the passion of repentance is not awakened, one can use a story from the Book of Tobit.  The young Tobias wishes to marry Sarah, the daughter of Raguel and Edna.  But the girl is surrounded in tragedy.  She has been betrothed to seven men all of whom have died in the bride’s house.  For my scenario this is a flaw in the story, since there is something almost irresistibly comical in the thought of a girl’s seven vain attempts to get married, although so near success, as near as a student who fails his finals seven times.  The Book of Tobit places the accent elsewhere and that makes the high number important and in a certain sense even contributes to the tragic effect.  It enhances the young Tobias’s high-mindedness, partly because he is his parents’ only son (6.14), partly because the deterrent obtrudes the more strongly.  So this feature must be omitted.  Sarah, then, is a girl who has never been in love, who still nurtures a young girl’s notion of bliss, her immense mortgage in life, her Vollmachtbrief zum Glücke authorization for happiness - to love a man with all her heart.  And yet she is the most unhappy of all, for she knows that the evil demon that loves her will kill the bridegroom on the wedding night.  I have read of much sorrow, but I doubt if anywhere there is a sorrow as deep as that residing in the life of that girl.  Nevertheless when the misfortune comes from outside there is a certain consolation.  If life fails to bring a person what would make him happy, it is still a comfort that he could have received it.  But the unfathomable sorrow which no time can disperse, no time heal, is to know that it would be no use even if life were to do everything! A Greek author conceals so infinitely much in his crude naïvet é when he says: ‘pantos gar oudeis Erota epfugen i feuksetai mechri an kallos i kai ofthalmoi Bleposin’ ’...  for certainly no one has yet altogether escaped love, and none shall so long as there is beauty and eyes to see‘ (cf.  Longi Pastoralia).  Many a girl has been made unhappy in love, but she became unhappy; Sarah was so before she became it.  It is hard enough that one should not find the one to whom one can devote oneself, but unspeakably hard to be unable to devote oneself.  A young girl surrenders herself to someone and then she is said no longer to be free, but Sarah was never free and yet never surrendered herself to anyone.  It is hard enough that a girl should surrender herself to someone and be deceived by her love, but Sarah was deceived before she surrendered herself.  What world of sorrow is not contained in what follows, when at length Tobias wishes to marry Sarah! What wedding-rites, what preparations! No girl was ever cheated as Sarah.  She was cheated of the most blessed of all things, the absolute wealth which even the poorest girl possesses, cheated of the secure, unbounded, unfettered, unbridled self-surrender of devotion.  For first there had to be the ritual of purification by placing the heart of a fish and its liver on glowing embers.  And what a mother’s leave-taking of the daughter who, just as she herself has been cheated of everything, must also cheat her own mother of her most beautiful possession.  One just reads the narrative.  Edna prepared the chamber and brought Sarah into it and wept, and she received the tears of her daughter - and said to her, ‘My child, take heart.  The Lord of heaven and earth may exchange your sorrow for joy.  Daughter, take heart.’ And now the moment for the wedding.  We read on, if we can for tears: ‘But when the door was shut and they were together, Tobias rose from the bed and said, “Rise up, sister, and we will pray that the Lord may have mercy on us”’ (8.4).  Were a poet to read this story and use it, I wager a hundred to one he would place all the emphasis on the young Tobias.  The heroism of being willing to risk his life in such obvious danger, of which the narrative reminds us once again, for the morning after the wedding Raguel says to Edna: ‘Send one of the maids to see if he is still alive, so that, if not, we can bury him and no one will know it’ (cf.  8.13) - this heroism would have been the theme for the poet.  I venture to propose another.  Certainly Tobias acted gallantly, resolutely, and chivalrously, but any man who lacks courage to do that is a milksop who knows neither what love is nor what it is to be a man, nor what is worth living for.  He has not even grasped the little mystery that it is better to give than to receive, and has no inkling of what the great mystery is, namely that it is much harder to receive than to give, that is if one has had the courage to go without and did not prove a coward in the hour of need.  No, Sarah is the heroine.  Her I would like to draw close to as I have drawn close to no other girl, or been tempted to draw close in thought to anyone of whom I have read.  For what love for God it takes to want to be healed when one has been crippled from the start for no fault of one’s own, an unsuccessful specimen of humanity from the very beginning! What ethical maturity to take on the responsibility of allowing the loved one such an act of daring! What humility before another person! What faith in God that in the next instant she should not hate the man to whom she owed everything! Let Sarah be a man and the demonic will not be far away.  A proud and noble nature can endure everything, but one thing it cannot endure, it cannot endure pity.  Pity implies an indignity that for such a person can only be inflicted from above, for in himself he can never become an object of pity.  If he has sinned he can endure the punishment without despairing, but to be singled out from his mother’s womb as an object of pity, a sweet fragrance in pity’s nostrils, that he cannot bear.  Pity has a curious dialectic; one moment it calls for guilt, the next it wants to do away with it, and so to be predestined to pity is the more dreadful the greater the individual’s misfortune lies in the direction of the spiritual.  But no guilt attaches to Sarah, she is thrown as a prey to every suffering and on top of that has to be tortured by human sympathy, for even I who admire her more than Tobias loves her, even I cannot mention her name without exclaiming ‘The poor girl!’ Let a man take Sarah’s place, let him know that if he is to love a girl an infernal spirit will come and murder her on the wedding night, then he would certainly be likely to choose the demonic, shut himself up in himself and say in his heart, as does the demonic nature, ‘Thanks, I am no friend of ceremony and fuss, I don’t at all insist on the pleasures of love, I can just as well be a Bluebeard who gets his pleasure seeing girls die on their wedding night.’ One generally hears very little about the demonic, in spite of this territory’s having a peculiarly valid claim to discovery in our time, and notwithstanding that once he knows how to establish a certain rapport with the demon an observer can, at least in some respect or other, use almost anyone as an example.  In this respect Shakespeare is and will always remain a hero.  That horrid demon, the most demonic figure Shakespeare ever portrayed, and did so incomparably, Gloucester (later Richard III), what made him a demon? Obviously that he could not endure the pity that had been piled on him from childhood.  His monologue in the first act of King Richard III is worth more than all moral systems, none of which bears a hint of the terrors of existence and of their nature.  I, that am rudely stamped, and want love’s majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion, Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up, And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them ...  Natures like Gloucester’s cannot be saved by mediating them into an idea of society.  Ethics really only makes fun of them, just as it would make a mockery of Sarah if it were to say to her, ‘Why don’t you express the universal and get married?’ Such natures are aboriginally in the paradox, and they are by no means less perfect than others; it is only that they are either damned in the demonic paradox or delivered in the divine.  Now people have been pleased to think from time immemorial that witches, gnomes, trolls, etc.  are misshapen creatures, and it is undeniable that we all have a tendency when we see a misshapen person directly to link this idea with that of moral perversion.  But what colossal injustice! It should really be the other way around.  It is life itself that has corrupted them, as a stepmother makes degenerates of her stepchildren.  To be put outside the universal from the start, by nature or by historical circumstance, that is the beginning of the demonic, and the individual can hardly be blamed for that.  So Cumberland’s Jew is also a demon notwithstanding his beneficence.  Thus the demonic can also express itself in contempt for men, a contempt which it should nevertheless be noted does not make the demonic person himself act contemptuously; on the contrary his strength is his knowledge that he is better than all who pass judgement on him.  — On all such matters the poets should be the first to make a stir.  God knows what books our young versifiers are reading these days! Their studies are no doubt confined to learning rhymes by rote.  Heaven knows what importance they have in life! Just now I couldn’t honestly tell you whether they are good for anything but to give us edifying proof of the immortality of the soul, to the extent at least that one can safely say of them what Baggesen says of the city’s poet, Kildevalle: ‘if he is immortal then we all are’.  - What has been said here about Sarah, almost in the style of a poetic production, appealing therefore in effect only to the imagination, finds its full significance if out of psychological interest one probes the meaning of the old saying: ‘ nullum unquam exstitit magnum ingenium sine aliqua dementia’ ‘there was never great genius without some madness’.  For the dementia here is the genius’s suffering in life, is the expression, if I may say so, of divine jealousy, while genius itself is the mark of divine favour.  Thus the genius is disorientated from the start in relation to the universal and put into relation to the paradox, whether, in despair over his own limitation, which in his own eyes turns his omnipotence into impotence, he seeks a demonic reassurance and therefore will not admit the limitation to either God or man, or he reassures himself religiously in love for the divine.  There are psychological topics here to which it seems to me one could happily devote a lifetime, and yet we so rarely hear a word about them.  How is madness related to genius? Can the one be constructed out of the other? In what sense and to what extent is the genius master of his own madness? For it goes without saying that to some degree he is indeed its master, otherwise he would really be mad.  Performing such observations requires, however, a high order of ingenuity as well as love, since performing observations on people of superior talent is extremely difficult.  If one bears this in mind in reading some of those authors most celebrated for their genius, it is conceivable that one might just, once in a while, though only with great effort, find out something.  I would like to consider one more case of an individual wanting to save the universal by his concealment and silence.  I shall take the legend of Faust.  Faust is a doubter, 13 an apostate of the spirit who goes the way of the flesh.  This is how the poets see it, and although it is repeated over and over again that every age has its Faust, poets still doggedly follow one another down this same beaten path.  Let us make a slight change.  Faust is a doubter kat‘eksochen in an eminent sense; but he has a sympathetic nature.  Even in Goethe’s understanding of Faust I miss a deeper psychological insight into the secret conversations which doubt has with itself.  Nowadays, when indeed all have experienced doubt, no poet has as yet made a move in this direction.  I could think of offering them Royal Securities to write on, to put down ‘all’ they have experienced in this regard - for it is unlikely that what they have to say will take more than the left-hand margin.  Only when one turns Faust back in on himself in this way — only then can the doubt appear poetically, only then does he himself genuinely discover in reality all its sufferings.  Then he knows it is spirit that sustains life, but he also knows that the security and happiness people live in are not supported by the power of spirit but can be readily explained as unreflective bliss.  As a doubter, as the doubter, he is above all that, and if someone wants to deceive him into supposing that he had put doubt behind him, he easily sees through that.  One who has made a movement in the world of spirit, hence an infinite movement, can tell at once from the spoken line whether the speaker is a man of experience or a Münchhausen.  What a Tamerlane could do with his Huns, Faust knows he can do with his doubt - frighten people out of their wits, make the very world shake under their feet, send people scattering in every direction, and cause the cry of alarm to sound from every quarter.  And if he does that he is still not a Tamerlane, for having the warrant of thought he is in a sense authorized to act in this way.  But Faust has a sympathetic nature, he loves life, his soul knows no envy, he sees he would be unable to prevent the landslide that would no doubt be set in motion, he has no wish for Herostratic honour — he remains silent, he hides his doubt in his soul more assiduously than the girl the fruit of her sinful love beneath her heart, he tries as well as he can to walk in step with others, but as far as what goes on inside him, that he consumes internally and in this way he makes himself a sacrifice to the universal.  Sometimes, when some eccentric raises the whirlwind of doubt, one hears the complaint: ‘If only he had kept quiet.’ Faust too represents this notion.  Anyone with any idea of what it means to live on spirit knows also what the hunger of doubt means, and that the doubter hungers just as much for the daily bread of life as for the sustenance of spirit.  Even though all the pain Faust suffers can be a fairly good argument for its not being pride that possesses him, I shall nevertheless avail myself of a small precautionary device which is easy enough for me to come by, who, just as Gregory of Rimini was called tortor infantium because he subscribed to the damnation of infants, might be tempted to call myself tortor heroum - I am very inventive when it comes to torturing heroes.  Faust sees Marguerite - not after he has chosen the life of pleasure, since my Faust doesn’t choose pleasure at all - he sees Marguerite not in Mephistopheles’s concave mirror but in all her lovable innocence, and because his soul has preserved its love for humankind he can also very well fall in love with her.  But he is a doubter, his doubt has destroyed reality for him.  So ideal is my Faust that he is not one of those scientific doubters who doubt for an hour every term at the lectern but can otherwise do anything, as indeed they do without the help of spirit or on its strength.  He is a doubter, and the doubter hungers as much for his daily slice of joy as for the nourishment of spirit.  But still he stays true to his decision, is silent, and talks to no one of his doubt, nor to Marguerite of his love.  It goes without saying that Faust is too ideal a figure to be satisfied with the tattle that if he spoke he would only set a more general discussion in motion, or that the whole affair would blow over without consequences, or perhaps this or perhaps that.  (Here, as will be obvious to any poet, lies the dormant comedy in our scenario, bringing Faust into ironical relation to those slapstick fools who nowadays chase after doubt, produce an external argument, e.g.  a doctor’s certificate, to show that they have really doubted, or take an oath that they have doubted everything, or else prove it by the fact that on their journey they met up with a doubter — those express couriers and sprint-experts in the world of spirit who in all haste gather a little hint of doubt from this person and a little hint of faith from that, and then wirtschafte do business as best they may depending on whether the congregation wants fine sand or coarse sand.) Faust is too ideal a figure to walk about in slippers.  No one who lacks an infinite passion is ideal and anyone who does have an infinite passion has long since saved his soul from such rubbish.  He is silent so as to offer himself - or else he talks, well knowing that he will put everything into confusion.  He is silent, so ethics condemns him.  It says: ‘You must acknowledge the universal, and you do that by speaking, and you dare not take pity on the universal.’ This is something one should not forget when one sometimes judges a doubter severely for speaking.  I myself am not inclined to judge such conduct leniently, but here as everywhere it is a question of the movements occurring properly.  If things go wrong, then a doubter, even if by speaking he should bring all manner of misfortune upon the world, would still be far preferable to these miserable sweet-tooths who try a taste of everything and would cure doubt without being acquainted with it, and are therefore as a rule the immediate cause of outbreaks of ungoverned and unmanageable doubt.  - If he speaks he confuses everything, for if nothing happens he only finds that out afterwards, and the consequence can be of no help either in the moment of acting or in questions of responsibility.  If he is silent on his own responsibility, he may indeed be acting magnanimously, but to his other pains there is added a little temptation.  The universal will be forever plaguing him and saying, ‘You should have spoken, how can you be certain that it wasn’t after all some hidden pride that prompted your decision?’ If on the other hand the doubter can be the single individual who as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute, then he receives authorization for his silence.  But then he must make guilt of his doubt.  But then he is in the paradox.  But then his doubt is cured, even though he can acquire another.  Even the New Testament would approve such a silence.  There are passages in the New Testament even extolling irony, so long as it is the better side that it is used to conceal.  However, this movement is just as much a movement of irony as any other movement based on subjectivity’s being higher than reality.  This is something no one nowadays wants to know; generally people want to know no more about irony than Hegel has said about it, though curiously enough he had rather little understanding of it and indeed bore a grudge against it which our age finds good reason not to give up, seeing that for it irony is simply something it must guard itself against.  The Sermon on the Mount says: ‘But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to fast.’ The passage gives clear testimony to subjectivity’s incommensurability with reality, indeed even to its having the right to deceive.  If only those people who wander about these days with vague talk of the idea of the congregation would read the New Testament, they might come upon other ideas.  But now Abraham.  How did he act? For I have not forgotten, and the reader may now be pleased to recall, that this was the point to which the whole preceding discussion was intended to lead.  Not to make Abraham more intelligible thereby, but in order that his unintelligibility might be seen more in the round, for, as I have said, I cannot understand Abraham, I can only admire him.  It was also mentioned that none of the stages described contained an analogue of Abraham, they were elaborated only so as to indicate, from the point of view of their own sphere, the boundary of the unknown land by the points of discrepancy.  If there should be any question of an analogy here it would have to be the paradox of sin, but that again belongs to another sphere and cannot explain Abraham, and is itself far easier to explain than Abraham.  So Abraham did not speak.  He spoke neither to Sarah, to Eleazar, nor to Isaac.  He passed over these three ethical authorities.  Because for Abraham the ethical had no higher expression than that of family life.  Aesthetics allowed, in fact demanded, silence of the individual when by remaining silent he could save another.  This is already enough to show that Abraham does not lie within the circumference of aesthetics.  His silence is not at all to save Isaac, as in general the whole task of sacrificing Isaac for his own and God’s sake is an outrage aesthetically.  Aesthetics can well understand that I sacrifice myself, but not that I should sacrifice another for my own sake.  The aesthetic hero was silent.  Ethics condemned him, however, because it was on the strength of his accidental particularity that he remained silent.  His human prescience was what determined that he should be silent.  This ethics cannot forgive.  All such human insight is only an illusion.  Ethics demands an infinite movement which requires disclosure.  So the aesthetic hero can indeed speak but will not.  The genuine tragic hero sacrifices himself and everything he has for the universal; his action, every emotion in him belongs to the universal, he is revealed, and in this disclosure he is the beloved son of ethics.  This does not apply to Abraham.  He does nothing for the universal and he is concealed.  We are now at the paradox.  Either the individual as the particular can stand in an absolute relation to the absolute, and then the ethical is not the highest, or Abraham is done for, he is neither a tragic hero nor an aesthetic hero.  Here again the paradox might seem the easiest and most convenient thing of all.  However, I must repeat that anyone who remains convinced of that is not the knight of faith, for distress and anguish are the only justification conceivable, even though they cannot be conceived in general, for if they could the paradox would be cancelled.  Abraham is silent — but he cannot speak, therein lies the distress and anguish.  For if when I speak I cannot make myself understood, I do not speak even if I keep talking without stop day and night.  This is the case with Abraham.  He can say what he will, but there is one thing he cannot say and since he cannot say it, i.e.  say it in a way that another understands it, he does not speak.  The relief of speech is that it translates me into the universal.  Now Abraham can say the most beautiful things any language can muster about how he loves Isaac.  But this is not what he has in mind, that being the deeper thought that he would have to sacrifice Isaac because it was a trial.  This no one can understand, and so no one can but misunderstand the former.  Of this distress the tragic hero knows nothing.  In the first place he has the consolation that all counter-arguments have been done justice to, that he has been able to give Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, Achilles, the Chorus, every living being, every voice from the heart of humankind, every intelligent, every anxious, every accusing, every compassionate thought an opportunity to stand up against him.  He can be sure that all that it is possible to say against him has been said, unsparingly, mercilessly - and to contend with the whole world is a comfort, but to contend with oneself dreadful.  - He need have no fear of having overlooked something, of later having to cry out like King Edward IV at the news of the death of Clarence: Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath, Kneeled at my feet and bid me be advised? Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love? The tragic hero knows nothing of the terrible responsibility of solitude.  Moreover, he has the comfort of being able to weep and wail with Clytemnestra and Iphigenia - and sobbing and crying give relief, while groans that cannot be uttered are torture.  Agamemnon can rally himself quickly to the certainty that he will act, and he therefore still has time to bring comfort and courage.  This Abraham cannot do.  When his heart is stirred, when his words would convey a blessed consolation for the whole world, he dare not console, for would not Sarah, would not Eleazar, would not Isaac say to him, ‘Why do you want to do this, you can after all refrain’? And if in his distress he should want to unburden his feelings and embrace everything dear to him before taking the final step, then this might have the most frightful consequence that Sarah, that Eleazar, that Isaac would be offended in him and believe him a hypocrite.  Talk he cannot, he speaks no human language.  Though he himself understood all the tongues of the world, though the loved ones understood them too — he still could not talk - he speaks a divine tongue - he ‘speaks with tongues’.  This distress I can well understand.  I can admire Abraham.  I have no fear that anyone should be tempted by this story to want irresponsibly to be the single individual.  But I also confess that I myself lack the courage for that, and that I would gladly renounce any prospect of coming further if only it were possible for me to come that far, however late in the day.  Abraham can refrain at any moment, he can repent the whole thing as a temptation.  Then he can speak, then all will understand him — but then he is no longer Abraham.  Abraham cannot speak.  What would explain everything, that it is a trial - though note, one in which the ethical is the temptation - is something he cannot say (i.e.  in a way that can be understood).  Anyone so placed is an emigrant from the sphere of the universal.  And yet what comes next he is even less able to say.  For, as was made sufficiently clear earlier, Abraham makes two movements.  He makes the infinite movement of resignation and gives up his claim to Isaac, something no one can understand because it is a private undertaking.  But then he further makes, and at every moment is making, the movement of faith.  This is his comfort.  For he says, ‘Nevertheless it won’t happen, or if it does the Lord will give me a new Isaac on the strength of the absurd.’ The tragic hero does at least get to the end of the story.  Iphigenia bows to her father’s decision, she herself makes the infinite movement of resignation and they now understand one another.  She is able to understand Agamemnon because his undertaking expresses the universal.  If on the other hand Agamemnon were to say to her, ‘Even though the deity demands you as a sacrifice, it’s still possible that he didn’t — on the strength of the absurd’, he would instantly become unintelligible to her.  If he could say it on the strength of human calculation, then Iphigenia would surely understand him.  But that would mean that Agamemnon had not made the infinite movement of resignation, and then he would not be a hero, and then the seer’s utterance is just a traveller’s tale and the whole incident a piece of vaudeville.  So Abraham did not speak.  Only one word of his has been preserved, his only reply to Isaac, which we can take to be sufficient evidence that he had not spoken previously.  Isaac asks Abraham where the lamb is for the burnt offering.  ‘And Abraham said: My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.’ This last word of Abraham’s I shall consider here a little more closely.  If it had not occurred the whole incident would lack something.  If it had been a different word everything might dissolve in confusion.  I have often pondered on how far a tragic hero, whether suffering or action provides the consummation of his heroism, ought to have a final remark.  So far as I can see it depends on what sphere of life he belongs to, on the extent to which his life has intellectual significance, on how far his suffering or action stand in relation to spirit.  It goes without saying that at the moment of consummation the tragic hero, like anyone else, is capable of a few words, even a few appropriate words.  But the question is whether it is appropriate for him to say them.  If the significance of his life consists in an outward act, then he has nothing to say, since everything he says is essentially idle chat which can only weaken the impact he makes, while the rites of tragedy require on the contrary that he fulfil his task in silence, whether in action or suffering.  So as not to go too far afield I shall simply draw on our nearest example.  If Agamemnon himself, and not Calchas the seer, had had to draw the knife on Iphigenia he would only have demeaned himself by wanting to say a few words at the last moment.  Everyone knew the significance of his deed, the whole process of piety, pity, feeling, and tears was done with, and besides, his life had no relation to spirit, i.e.  he was not a teacher or a witness to the spirit.  If on the other hand the significance of the hero’s life tends towards spirit, the lack of a remark will weaken the impact he makes.  It is not something appropriate he should be saying, not some bit of rhetoric, but something that will convey that he is consummating himself in the decisive moment.  An intellectual tragic hero of this kind should allow himself what people often aspire to frivolously, namely having and keeping the last word.  We expect of him the same exalted bearing as becomes any tragic hero, but on top of that we expect some word.  So if an intellectual tragic hero consummates his heroism in suffering (in death), in this final word he will become immortal before he dies, while the ordinary tragic hero only becomes immortal after his death.  Socrates can be used as an example.  He was an intellectual tragic hero.  He hears his death-sentence.  That instant he dies.  Unless you grasp that it requires all the strength of spirit to die, that the hero always dies before his death, you will not come particularly far in your observations on life.  So as a hero Socrates is required to stay calm and at ease, but as an intellectual hero he is required to have sufficient spiritual strength at the final moment to fulfil himself.  So he cannot, like the ordinary tragic hero, concentrate on keeping himself face to face with death; he has to make this latter movement so quickly that in the same instant he is consciously above that conflict and continues to assert himself.  Had Socrates been silent in the crisis of death he would have weakened the effect of his life, aroused a suspicion that the resilience of irony was not, in him, a primitive strength, but only a game whose flexibility he had to exploit in the decisive moment, according to an opposite standard, pathetically to sustain himself.  14 What I have been briefly hinting at here doesn’t really apply to Abraham, to the extent that one supposes one might find by analogy some appropriate word for Abraham; but it applies to the extent that one sees the necessity of Abraham’s fulfilling himself at the final moment not by drawing the knife silently but by having something to say, seeing that as the father of faith he has absolute significance in terms of spirit.  As to what he is to say, I can form no idea in advance.  Once he has said it I can no doubt understand it, even in a sense understand Abraham in what is said, yet without thereby coming any nearer him than in the foregoing.  If we’d had no remark from Socrates I could have put myself into his position and made one, and if I couldn’t do that myself, a poet would have managed.  But no poet can reach Abraham.  Before going on to consider Abraham’s last word more closely, I must first draw attention to the difficulty of Abraham’s coming to say anything at all.  The distress and anguish in the paradox consisted, as explained above, precisely in the silence; Abraham cannot speak.  15 To that extent then it is self-contradictory to demand that he should speak, unless one wants him out of the paradox again, so that in the decisive moment he suspends it, whereby he ceases to be Abraham and brings to naught all that went before.  Were Abraham, at the decisive moment, to say to Isaac, ‘It is you who are to be sacrificed’, this would only be a weakness.  For if he could speak at all he should have done so long before, and the weakness then consists in his not having the maturity of spirit and concentration to imagine the whole of the pain beforehand but having pushed some of it aside so that the actual pain proves greater than the imagined one.  Besides, with talk of this kind he would fall out of the paradox, and if he really wanted to talk to Isaac he would have to transform his own situation into that of a temptation.  Otherwise, after all, he could say nothing and if he does so transform his situation he isn’t even a tragic hero.  Nevertheless a last word of Abraham’s has been preserved, and so far as I can understand the paradox I can also understand Abraham’s total presence in that word.  First and foremost he doesn’t say anything, and that is his way of saying what he has to say.  His answer to Isaac has the form of irony, for it is always irony to say something and yet not say it.  Isaac asks Abraham because he assumes Abraham knows.  Now if Abraham had replied, ‘I know nothing’, he would have uttered an untruth.  He cannot say anything, since what he knows he cannot say.  So he replies, ‘My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.’ Here one sees the double movement in Abraham’s soul, as it has been described in the foregoing.  Had Abraham simply renounced his claim to Isaac and done no more, he would have uttered an untruth.  He knows that God demands the sacrifice of Isaac, and he knows that precisely at this moment he himself is ready to sacrifice him.  So, after having made this movement Abraham has at every instant been performing the next, making the movement on the strength of the absurd.  To that extent he utters no untruth, for on the strength of the absurd it is after all possible that God might do something quite different.  He utters no untruth then, but neither does he say anything, for he speaks in a foreign tongue.  This becomes still more obvious when we consider that it was Abraham himself who was to sacrifice Isaac.  If the task had been a different one, if the Lord had commanded Abraham to take Isaac out on the mountain in Moriah, and then let his own lightning strike Isaac and take him as a sacrifice in that way, Abraham would in a straightforward sense be right to talk as enigmatically as he did, for in that case he himself could not have known what would happen.  But as the task is given to Abraham, it is he who must act, so he must know at the decisive moment what he is about to do, and accordingly must know that Isaac is to be sacrificed.  If he doesn’t definitely know that, he hasn’t made the infinite movement of resignation, in which case his words are not indeed untrue, but then at the same time he is very far from being Abraham, he is less significant than a tragic hero, he is in fact an irresolute man who can resolve to do neither one thing nor the other, and who will therefore always come to talk in riddles.  But such a Haesitator waverer is simply a parody of the knight of faith.  Here too it can appear that one can understand Abraham, but only as one understands the paradox.  For my part I can in a way understand Abraham, but I see very well that I lack the courage to speak in this way, as much as I lack the courage to act like Abraham.  But I do not at all say that what he did is inconsiderable on that account, since on the contrary it is the one and only marvel.  And what did contemporaries think of the tragic hero? That he was great, and they looked up to him.  And that noble assembly of worthies, the jury that every generation appoints to pass judgement on its predecessor, came to the same verdict.  But none could understand Abraham.  And yet think what he achieved! To remain true to his love.  But he who loves God has no need of tears, needs no admiration, and forgets his suffering in love, indeed forgets so completely that afterwards not the least hint of his pain would remain were God himself not to remember it; for God sees in secret and knows the distress and counts the tears and forgets nothing.  So either there is a paradox, that the single individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute, or Abraham is done for.  Discover your next great read!

The Ethics of Ambiguity CONCLUSION Is this kind of ethics individualistic or not? Yes, if one means by that that it accords to the individual an absolute value and that it recognizes in him alone the power of laying the foundations of his own existence.  It is individualism in the sense in which the wisdom of the ancients, the Christian ethics of salvation, and the Kantian ideal of virtue also merit this name; it is opposed to the totalitarian doctrines which raise up beyond man the mirage of Mankind.  But it is not solipsistic, since the individual is defined only by his relationship to the world and to other individuals; he exists only by transcending himself, and his freedom can be achieved only through the freedom of others.  He justifies his existence by a movement which, like freedom, springs from his heart but which leads outside of him.  This individualism does not lead to the anarchy of personal whim.  Man is free; but he finds his law in his very freedom.  First, he must assume his freedom and not flee it; he assumes it by a constructive movement: one does not exist without doing something; and also by a negative movement which rejects oppression for oneself and others.  In construction, as in rejection, it is a matter of reconquering freedom on the contingent facticity of existence, that is, of taking the given, which, at the start, is there without any reason, as something willed by man.  A conquest of this kind is never finished; the contingency remains, and, so that he may assert his will, man is even obliged to stir up in the world the outrage he does not want.  But this element of failure is a very condition of his life; one can never dream of eliminating it without immediately dreaming of death.  This does not mean that one should consent to failure, but rather one must consent to struggle against it without respite.  Yet, isn’t this battle without victory pure gullibility? It will be argued that this is only a ruse of transcendance projecting before itself a goal which constantly recedes, running after itself on an endless treadmill; to exist for Mankind is to remain where one is, and it fools itself by calling this turbulent stagnation progress; our whole ethics does nothing but encourage it in this lying enterprise since we are asking each one to confirm existence as a value for all others; isn’t it simply a matter of organizing among men a complicity which allows them to substitute a game of illusions for the given world? We have already attempted to answer mis objection.  One can formulate it only by placing himself on the grounds of an inhuman and consequently false objectivity; within Mankind men may be fooled; the word “lie” has a meaning by opposition to the truth established by men themselves, but Mankind can not fool itself completely since it is precisely Mankind which creates the criteria of true and false.  In Plato, art is mystification because there is the heaven of Ideas; but in the earthly domain all glorification of the earth is true as soon as it is realized.  Let men attach value to words, forms, colors, mathematical theorems, physical laws, and athletic prowess; let them accord value to one another in love and friendship, and the objects, the events, and the men immediately have this value; they have it absolutely.  It is possible that a man may refuse to love anything on earth; he will prove this refusal and he will carry it out by suicide.  If he lives, the reason is that, whatever he may say, there still remains in him some attachment to existence; his life will be commensurate with this attachment; it will justify itself to the extent that it genuinely justifies the world.  This justification, though open upon the entire universe through time and space, will always be finite.  Whatever one may do, one never realizes anything but a limited work, like existence itself which tries to establish itself through that work and which death also limits.  It is the assertion of our finiteness which doubtless gives the doctrine which we have just evoked its austerity and, in some eyes, its sadness.  As soon as one considers a system abstractly and theoretically, one puts himself, in effect, on the plane of the universal, thus, of the infinite.  That is why reading the Hegelian system is so comforting.  I remember having experienced a great feeling of calm on reading Hegel in the impersonal framework of the Bibliotheque Nationale in August 1940.  But once I got into the street again, into my life, out of the system, beneath a real sky, the system was no longer of any use to me: what it had offered me, under a show of the infinite, was the consolations of death; and I again wanted to live in the midst of living men.  I think that, inversely, existentialism does not offer to the reader the consolations of an abstract evasion: existentialism proposes no evasion.  On the contrary, its ethics is experienced in the truth of life, and it then appears as the only proposition of salvation which one can address to men.  Taking on its own account Descartes’ revolt against the evil genius, the pride of the thinking reed in the face of the universe which crushes him, it asserts that, despite his limits, through them, it is up to each one to fulfill his existence as an absolute.  Regardless of the staggering dimensions of the world about us, the density of our ignorance, the risks of catastrophes to come, and our individual weakness within the immense collectivity, the fact remains that we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite.  And in fact, any man who has known real loves, real revolts, real desires, and real will knows quite well that he has no need of any outside guarantee to be sure of his goals; their certitude comes from his own drive.  There is a very old saying which goes: “Do what you must, come what may.” That amounts to saying in a different way that the result is not external to the good will which fulfills itself in aiming at it.  If it came to be that each man did what he must, existence would be saved in each one without there being any need of dreaming of a paradise where all would be reconciled in death.

I “T HE continous work of our life,” says Montaigne, “is to build death.” He quotes the Latin poets: Prima, quae vitam dedit, hora corpsit.  And again: Nascentes morimur.  Man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo.  A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny.  “Rational animal,” “thinking reed,” he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it.  He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness.  He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things.  At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence.  But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing.  This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men.  In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.  As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it.  They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance.  Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved.  They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality.  Or, again they have denied life, considering it as a veil of illusion beneath which is hidden the truth of Nirvana.  And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued the same goal.  It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or by being engulfed in it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment.  Hegel, with more ingenuity, tried to reject none of the aspects of man’s condition and to reconcile them all.  According to his system, the moment is preserved in the development of time; Nature asserts itself in the face of Spirit which denies it while assuming it; the individual is again found in the collectivity within which he is lost; and each man’s death is fulfilled by being canceled out into the Life of Mankind.  One can thus repose in a marvelous optimism where even the bloody wars simply express the fertile restlessness of the Spirit.  At the present time there still exist many doctrines which choose to leave in the shadow certain troubling aspects of a too complex situation.  But their attempt to lie to us is in vain.  Cowardice doesn’t pay.  Those reasonable metaphysics, those consoling ethics with which they would like to entice us only accentuate the disorder from which we suffer.  Men of today seem to feel more acutely than ever the paradox of their condition.  They know themselves to be the supreme end to which all action should be subordinated, but the exigencies of action force them to treat one another as instruments or obstacles, as means.  The more widespread their mastery of the world, the more they find themselves crushed by uncontrollable forces.  Though they are masters of the atomic bomb, yet it is created only to destroy them.  Each one has the incomparable taste in his mouth of his own life, and yet each feels himself more insignificant than an insect within the immense collectivity whose limits are one with the earth’s.  Perhaps in no other age have they manifested their grandeur more brilliantly, and in no other age has this grandeur been so horribly flouted.  In spite of so many stubborn lies, at every moment, at every opportunity, the truth comes to light, the truth of life and death, of my solitude and my bond with the world, of my freedom and my servitude, of the insignificance and the sovereign importance of each man and all men.  There was Stalingrad and there was Buchenwald, and neither of the two wipes out the other.  Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us therefore try to look the truth in the face.  Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity.  It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.  From the very beginning, existentialism defined itself as a philosophy of ambiguity.  It was by affirming the irreducible character of ambiguity that Kierkegaard opposed himself to Hegel, and it is by ambiguity that, in our own generation, Sartre, in Being and Nothingness, fundamentally defined man, that being whose being is not to be, that subjectivity which realizes itself only as a presence in the world, that engaged freedom, that surging of the for-oneself which is immediately given for others.  But it is also claimed that existentialism is a philosophy of the absurd and of despair.  It encloses man in a sterile anguish, in an empty subjectivity.  It is incapable of furnishing him with any principle for making choices.  Let him do as he pleases.  In any case, the game is lost.  Does not Sartre declare, in effect, that man is a “useless passion,” that he tries in vain to realize the synthesis of the for-oneself and the in-oneself, to make himself God? It is true.  But it is also true that the most optimistic ethics have all begun by emphasizing the element of failure involved in the condition of man; without failure, no ethics; for a being who, from the very start, would be an exact co-incidence with himself, in a perfect plenitude, the notion of having-to-be would have no meaning.  One does not offer an ethics to a God.  It is impossible to propose any to man if one defines him as nature, as something given.  The so-called psychological or empirical ethics manage to establish themselves only by introducing surreptitiously some flaw within the manthing which they have first defined.  Hegel tells us in the last part of The Phenomenology of Mind that moral consciousness can exist only to the extent that there is disagreement between nature and morality.  It would disappear if the ethical law became the natural law.  To such an extent that by a paradoxical “displacement,” if moral action is the absolute goal, the absolute goal is also that moral action may not be present.  This means that there can be a having-to-be only for a being who, according to the existentialist definition, questions himself in his being, a being who is at a distance from himself and who has to be his being.  Well and good.  But it is still necessary for the failure to be surmounted, and existentialist ontology does not allow this hope.  Man’s passion is useless; he has no means for becoming the being that he is not.  That too is true.  And it is also true that in Being and Nothingness Sartre has insisted above all on the abortive aspect of the human adventure.  It is only in the last pages that he opens up the perspective for an ethics.  However, if we reflect upon his descriptions of existence, we perceive that they are far from condemning man without recourse.  The failure described in Being and Nothingness is definitive, but it is also ambiguous.  Man, Sartre tells us, is “a being who makes himself a lack of being in order that there might be being.” That means, first of all, that his passion is not inflicted upon him from without.  He chooses it.  It is his very being and, as such, does not imply the idea of unhappiness.  If this choice is considered as useless, it is because there exists no absolute value before the passion of man, outside of it, in relation to which one might distinguish the useless from the useful.  The word “useful” has not yet received a meaning on the level of description where Being and Nothingness is situated.  It can be defined only in the human world established by man’s projects and the ends he sets up.  In the original helplessness from which man surges up, nothing is useful, nothing is useless.  It must therefore be understood that the passion to which man has acquiesced finds no external justification.  No outside appeal, no objective necessity permits of its being called useful.  It has no reason to will itself.  But this does not mean that it can not justify itself, that it can not give itself reasons for being that it does not have.  And indeed Sartre tells us that man makes himself this lack of being in order that there might be being.  The term in order that clearly indicates an intentionality.  It is not in vain that man nullifies being.  Thanks to him, being is disclosed and he desires this disclosure.  There is an original type of attachment to being which is not the relationship “wanting to be” but rather “wanting to disclose being.” Now, here there is not failure, but rather success.  This end, which man proposes to himself by making himself lack of being, is, in effect, realized by him.  By uprooting himself from the world, man makes himself present to the world and makes the world present to him.  I should like to be the landscape which I am contemplating, I should like this sky, this quiet water to think themselves within me, that it might be I whom they express in flesh and bone, and I remain at a distance.  But it is also by this distance that the sky and the water exist before me.  My contemplation is an excruciation only because it is also a joy.  I can not appropriate the snow field where I slide.  It remains foreign, forbidden, but I take delight in this very effort toward an impossible possession.  I experience it as a triumph, not as a defeat.  This means that man, in his vain attempt to be God, makes himself exist as man, and if he is satisfied with this existence, he coincides exactly with himself.  It is not granted him to exist without tending toward this being which he will never be.  But it is possible for him to want this tension even with the failure which it involves.  His being is lack of being, but this lack has a way of being which is precisely existence.  In Hegelian terms it might be said that we have here a negation of the negation by which the positive is re-established.  Man makes himself a lack, but he can deny the lack as lack and affirm himself as a positive existence.  He then assumes the failure.  And the condemned action, insofar as it is an effort to be, finds its validity insofar as it is a manifestation of existence.  However, rather than being a Hegelian act of surpassing, it is a matter of a conversion.  For in Hegel the surpassed terms are preserved only as abstract moments, whereas we consider that existence still remains a negativity in the positive affirmation of itself.  And it does not appear, in its turn, as the term of a further synthesis.  The failure is not surpassed, but assumed.  Existence asserts itself as an absolute which must seek its justification within itself and not suppress itself, even though it may be lost by preserving itself.  To attain his truth, man must not attempt to dispel the ambiguity of his being but, on the contrary, accept the task of realizing it.  He rejoins himself only to the extent that he agrees to remain at a distance from himself.  This conversion is sharply distinguished from the Stoic conversion in that it does not claim to oppose to the sensible universe a formal freedom which is without content.  To exist genuinely is not to deny this spontaneous movement of my transcendence, but only to refuse to lose myself in it.  Existentialist conversion should rather be compared to Husserlian reduction: let man put his will to be “in parentheses” and he will thereby be brought to the consciousness of his true condition.  And just as phenomenological reduction prevents the errors of dogmatism by suspending all affirmation concerning the mode of reality of the external world, whose flesh and bone presence the reduction does not, however, contest, so existentialist conversion does not suppress my instincts, desires, plans, and passions.  It merely prevents any possibility of failure by refusing to set up as absolutes the ends toward which my transcendence thrusts itself, and by considering them in their connection with the freedom which projects them.  The first implication of such an attitude is that the genuine man will not agree to recognize any foreign absolute.  When a man projects into an ideal heaven that impossible synthesis of the for-itself and the in-itself that is called God, it is because he wishes the regard of this existing Being to change his existence into being; but if he agrees not to be in order to exist genuinely, he will abandon the dream of an inhuman objectivity.  He will understand that it is not a matter of being right in the eyes of a God, but of being right in his own eyes.  Renouncing the thought of seeking the guarantee for his existence outside of himself, he will also refuse to believe in unconditioned values which would set themselves up athwart his freedom like things.  Value is this lacking-being of which freedom makes itself a lack; and it is because the latter makes itself a lack that value appears.  It is desire which creates the desirable, and the project which sets up the end.  It is human existence which makes values spring up in the world on the basis of which it will be able to judge the enterprise in which it will be engaged.  But first it locates itself beyond any pessimism, as beyond any optimism, for the fact of its original springing forth is a pure contingency.  Before existence there is no more reason to exist than not to exist.  The lack of existence can not be evaluated since it is the fact on the basis of which all evaluation is defined.  It can not be compared to anything for there is nothing outside of it to serve as a term of comparison.  This rejection of any extrinsic justification also confirms the rejection of an original pessimism which we posited at the beginning.  Since it is unjustifiable from without, to declare from without that it is unjustifiable is not to condemn it.  And the truth is that outside of existence there is nobody.  Man exists.  For him it is not a question of wondering whether his presence in the world is useful, whether life is worth the trouble of being lived.  These questions make no sense.  It is a matter of knowing whether he wants to live and under what conditions.  But if man is free to define for himself the conditions of a life which is valid in his own eyes, can he not choose whatever he likes and act however he likes? Dostoievsky asserted, “If God does not exist, everything is permitted.” Today’s believers use this formula for their own advantage.  To re-establish man at the heart of his destiny is, they claim, to repudiate all ethics.  However, far from God’s absence authorizing all license, the contrary is the case, because man is abandoned on the earth, because his acts are definitive, absolute engagements.  He bears the responsibility for a world which is not the work of a strange power, but of himself, where his defeats are inscribed, and his victories as well.  A God can pardon, efface, and compensate.  But if God does not exist, man’s faults are inexpiable.  If it is claimed that, whatever the case may be, this earthly stake has no importance, this is precisely because one invokes that inhuman objectivity which we declined at the start.  One can not start by saying that our earthly destiny has or has not importance, for it depends upon us to give it importance.  It is up to man to make it important to be a man, and he alone can feel his success or failure.  And if it is again said that nothing forces him to try to justify his being in this way, then one is playing upon the notion of freedom in a dishonest way.  The believer is also free to sin.  The divine law is imposed upon him only from the moment he decides to save his soul.  In the Christian religion, though one speaks very little about them today, there are also the damned.  Thus, on the earthly plane, a life which does not seek to ground itself will be a pure contingency.  But it is permitted to wish to give itself a meaning and a truth, and it then meets rigorous demands within its own heart.  However, even among the proponents of secular ethics, there are many who charge existentialism with offering no objective content to the moral act.  It is said that this philosophy is subjective, even solipsistic.  If he is once enclosed within himself, how can man get out? But there too we have a great deal of dishonesty.  It is rather well known that the fact of being a subject is a universal fact and that the Cartesian cogito expresses both the most individual experience and the most objective truth.  By affirming that the source of all values resides in the freedom of man, existentialism merely carries on the tradition of Kant, Fichte, and Hegel, who, in the words of Hegel himself, “have taken for their point of departure the principle according to which the essence of right and duty and the essence of the thinking and willing subject are absolutely identical.” The idea that defines all humanism is that the world is not a given world, foreign to man, one to which he has to force himself to yield from without.  It is the world willed by man, insofar as his will expresses his genuine reality.  Some will answer, “All well and good.  But Kant escapes solipsism because for him genuine reality is the human person insofar as it transcends its empirical embodiment and chooses to be universal.” And doubtless Hegel asserted that the “right of individuals to their particularity is equally contained in ethical substantiality, since particularity is the extreme, phenomenal modality in which moral reality exists ( Philosophy of Right, § 154).” But for him particularity appears only as a moment of the totality in which it must surpass itself.  Whereas for existentialism, it is not impersonal universal man who is the source of values, but the plurality of concrete, particular men projecting themselves toward their ends on the basis of situations whose particularity is as radical and as irreducible as subjectivity itself.  How could men, originally separated, get together? And, indeed, we are coming to the real situation of the problem.  But to state it is not to demonstrate that it can not be resolved.  On the contrary, we must here again invoke the notion of Hegelian “displacement.” There is an ethics only if there is a problem to solve.  And it can be said, by inverting the preceding line of argument, that the ethics which have given solutions by effacing the fact of the separation of men are not valid precisely because there is this separation.  An ethics of ambiguity will be one which will refuse to deny a priori that separate existants can, at the same time, be bound to each other, that their individual freedoms can forge laws valid for all.  Before undertaking the quest for a solution, it is interesting to note that the notion of situation and the recognition of separation which it implies are not peculiar to existentialism.  We also meet it in Marxism which, from one point of view, can be considered as an apotheosis of subjectivity.  Like all radical humanism, Marxism rejects the idea of an inhuman objectivity and locates itself in the tradition of Kant and Hegel.  Unlike the old kind of Utopian socialism which confronted earthly order with the archetypes of Justice, Order, and Good, Marx does not consider that certain human situations are, in themselves and absolutely, preferable to others.  It is the needs of people, the revolt of a class, which define aims and goals.  It is from within a rejected situation, in the light of this rejection, that a new state appears as desirable; only the will of men decides; and it is on the basis of a certain individual act of rooting itself in the historical and economic world that this will thrusts itself toward the future and then chooses a perspective where such words as goal, progress, efficacy, success, failure, action, adversaries, instruments, and obstacles, have a meaning.  Then certain acts can be regarded as good and others as bad.  In order for the universe of revolutionary values to arise, a subjective movement must create them in revolt and hope.  And this movement appears so essential to Marxists that if an intellectual or a bourgeois also claims to want revolution, they distrust him.  They think that it is only from the outside, by abstract recognition, that the bourgeois intellectual can adhere to these values which he himself has not set up.  Regardless of what he does, his situation makes it impossible for the ends pursued by proletarians to be absolutely his ends too, since it is not the very impulse of his life which has begotten them.  However, in Marxism, if it is true that the goal and the meaning of action are defined by human wills, these wills do not appear as free.  They are the reflection of objective conditions by which the situation of the class or the people under consideration is defined.  In the present moment of the development of capitalism, the proletariat can not help wanting its elimination as a class.  Subjectivity is re-absorbed into the objectivity of the given world.  Revolt, need, hope, rejection, and desire are only the resultants of external forces.  The psychology of behavior endeavors to explain this alchemy.  It is known that that is the essential point on which existentialist ontology is opposed to dialectical materialism.  We think that the meaning of the situation does not impose itself on the consciousness of a passive subject, that it surges up only by the disclosure which a free subject effects in his project.  It appears evident to us that in order to adhere to Marxism, to enroll in a party, and in one rather than another, to be actively attached to it, even a Marxist needs a decision whose source is only in himself.  And this autonomy is not the privilege (or the defect) of the intellectual or the bourgeois.  The proletariat, taken as a whole, as a class, can become conscious of its situation in more than one way.  It can want the revolution to be brought about by one party or another.  It can let itself be lured on, as happened to the German proletariat, or can sleep in the dull comfort which capitalism grants it, as does the American proletariat.  It may be said that in all these cases it is betraying; still, it must be free to betray.  Or, if one pretends to distinguish the real proletariat from a treacherous proletariat, or a misguided or unconscious or mystified one, then it is no longer a flesh and blood proletariat that one is dealing with, but the idea of a proletariat, one of those ideas which Marx ridiculed.  Besides, in practice, Marxism does not always deny freedom.  The very notion of action would lose all meaning if history were a mechanical unrolling in which man appears only as a passive conductor of outside forces.  By acting, as also by preaching action, the Marxist revolutionary asserts himself as a veritable agent; he assumes himself to be free.  And it is even curious to note that most Marxists of today — unlike Marx himself — feel no repugnance at the edifying dullness of moralizing speeches.  They do not limit themselves to finding fault with their adversaries in the name of historical realism.  When they tax them with cowardice, lying, selfishness, and venality, they very well mean to condemn them in the name of a moralism superior to history.  Likewise, in the eulogies which they bestow upon each other they exalt the eternal virtues, courage, abnegation, lucidity, integrity.  It may be said that all these words are used for propagandistic purposes, that it is only a matter of expedient language.  But this is to admit that this language is heard, that it awakens an echo in the hearts of those to whom it is addressed.  Now, neither scorn nor esteem would have any meaning if one regarded the acts of a man as a purely mechanical resultant.  In order for men to become indignant or to admire, they must be conscious of their own freedom and the freedom of others.  Thus, everything occurs within each man and in the collective tactics as if men were free.  But then what revelation can a coherent humanism hope to oppose to the testimony which man brings to bear upon himself? So Marxists often find themselves having to confirm this belief in freedom, even if they have to reconcile it with determination as well as they can.  However, while this concession is wrested from them by the very practice of action, it is in the name of action that they attempt to condemn a philosophy of freedom.  They declare authoritatively that the existence of freedom would make any concerted enterprise impossible.  According to them, if the individual were not constrained by the external world to want this rather than that, there would be nothing to defend him against his whims.  Here, in different language, we again meet the charge formulated by the respectful believer of supernatural imperatives.  In the eyes of the Marxist, as of the Christian, it seems that to act freely is to give up justifying one’s acts.  This is a curious reversal of the Kantian “you must; therefore, you can.” Kant postulates freedom in the name of morality.  The Marxist, on the contrary, declares, “You must; therefore, you can not.” To him a man’s action seems valid only if the man has not helped set it going by an internal movement.  To admit the ontological possibility of a choice is already to betray the Cause.  Does this mean that the revolutionary attitude in any way gives up being a moral attitude? It would be logical, since we observed with Hegel that it is only insofar as the choice is not realized at first that it can be set up as a moral choice.  But here again Marxist thought hesitates.  It sneers at idealistic ethics which do not bite into the world; but its scoffing signifies that there can be no ethics outside of action, not that action lowers itself to the level of a simple natural process.  It is quite evident that the revolutionary enterprise has a human meaning.  Lenin’s remark, which says, in substance, “I call any action useful to the party moral action; I call it immoral if it is harmful to the party,” cuts two ways.  On the one hand, he refuses to accept outdated values, but he also sees in political operation a total manifestation of man as having-to-be at the same time as being.  Lenin refuses to set up ethics abstractly because he means to realize it effectively.  And yet a moral idea is present in the words, writings, and acts of Marxists.  It is contradictory, then, to reject with horror the moment of choice which is precisely the moment when spirit passes into nature, the moment of the concrete fulfillment of man and morality.  As for us, whatever the case may be, we believe in freedom.  Is it true that this belief must lead us to despair? Must we grant this curious paradox: that from the moment a man recognizes himself as free, he is prohibited from wishing for anything? On the contrary, it appears to us that by turning toward this freedom we are going to discover a principle of action whose range will be universal.  The characteristic feature of all ethics is to consider human life as a game that can be won or lost and to teach man the means of winning.  Now, we have seen that the original scheme of man is ambiguous: he wants to be, and to the extent that he coincides with this wish, he fails.  All the plans in which this will to be is actualized are condemned; and the ends circumscribed by these plans remain mirages.  Human transcendence is vainly engulfed in those miscarried attempts.  But man also wills himself to be a disclosure of being, and if he coincides with this wish, he wins, for the fact is that the world becomes present by his presence in it.  But the disclosure implies a perpetual tension to keep being at a certain distance, to tear oneself from the world, and to assert oneself as a freedom.  To wish for the disclosure of the world and to assert oneself as freedom are one and the same movement.  Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring.  It is the original condition of all justification of existence.  The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else.  At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally.  It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.  It is necessarily summoned up by the values which it sets up and through which it sets itself up.  It can not establish a denial of itself, for in denying itself, it would deny the possibility of any foundation.  To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision.  It seems that the Hegelian notion of “displacement” which we relied on a little while ago is now turning against us.  There is ethics only if ethical action is not present.  Now, Sartre declares that every man is free, that there is no way of his not being free.  When he wants to escape his destiny, he is still freely fleeing it.  Does not this presence of a so to speak natural freedom contradict the notion of ethical freedom? What meaning can there be in the words to will oneself free, since at the beginning we are free? It is contradictory to set freedom up as something conquered if at first it is something given.  This objection would mean something only if freedom were a thing or a quality naturally attached to a thing.  Then, in effect, one would either have it or not have it.  But the fact is that it merges with the very movement of this ambiguous reality which is called existence and which is only by making itself be; to such an extent that it is precisely only by having to be conquered that it gives itself.  To will oneself free is to effect the transition from nature to morality by establishing a genuine freedom on the original upsurge of our existence.  Every man is originally free, in the sense that he spontaneously casts himself into the world.  But if we consider this spontaneity in its facticity, it appears to us only as a pure contingency, an upsurging as stupid as the clinamen of the Epicurean atom which turned up at any moment whatsoever from any direction whatsoever.  And it was quite necessary for the atom to arrive somewhere.  But its movement was not justified by this result which had not been chosen.  It remained absurd.  Thus, human spontaneity always projects itself toward something.  The psychoanalyst discovers a meaning even in abortive acts and attacks of hysteria.  But in order for this meaning to justify the transcendence which discloses it, it must itself be founded, which it will never be if I do not choose to found it myself.  Now, I can evade this choice.  We have said that it would be contradictory deliberately to will oneself not free.  But one can choose not to will himself free.  In laziness, heedlessness, capriciousness, cowardice, impatience, one contests the meaning of the project at the very moment that one defines it.  The spontaneity of the subject is then merely a vain living palpitation, its movement toward the object is a flight, and itself is an absence.  To convert the absence into presence, to convert my flight into will, I must assume my project positively.  It is not a matter of retiring into the completely inner and, moreover, abstract movement of a given spontaneity, but of adhering to the concrete and particular movement by which this spontaneity defines itself by thrusting itself toward an end.  It is through this end that it sets up that my spontaneity confirms itself by reflecting upon itself.  Then, by a single movement, my will, establishing the content of the act, is legitimized by it.  I realize my escape toward the other as a freedom when, assuming the presence of the object, I thereby assume myself before it as a presence.  But this justification requires a constant tension.  My project is never founded; it founds itself.  To avoid the anguish of this permanent choice, one may attempt to flee into the object itself, to engulf one’s own presence in it.  In the servitude of the serious, the original spontaneity strives to deny itself.  It strives in vain, and meanwhile it then fails to fulfill itself as moral freedom.  We have just described only the subjective and formal aspect of this freedom.  But we also ought to ask ourselves whether one can will oneself free in any matter, whatsoever it may be.  It must first be observed that this will is developed in the course of time.  It is in time that the goal is pursued and that freedom confirms itself.  And this assumes that it is realized as a unity in the unfolding of time.  One escapes the absurdity of the clinamen only by escaping the absurdity of the pure moment.  An existence would be unable to found itself if moment by moment it crumbled into nothingness.  That is why no moral question presents itself to the child as long as he is still incapable of recognizing himself in the past or seeing himself in the future.  It is only when the moments of his life begin to be organized into behaviour that he can decide and choose.  The value of the chosen end is confirmed and, reciprocally, the genuineness of the choice is manifested concretely through patience, courage, and fidelity.  If I leave behind an act which I have accomplished, it becomes a thing by falling into the past.  It is no longer anything but a stupid and opaque fact.  In order to prevent this metamorphosis, I must ceaselessly return to it and justify it in the unity of the project in which I am engaged.  Setting up the movement of my transcendence requires that I never let it uselessly fall back upon itself, that I prolong it indefinitely.  Thus I can not genuinely desire an end today without desiring it through my whole existence, insofar as it is the future of this present moment and insofar as it is the surpassed past of days to come.  To will is to engage myself to persevere in my will.  This does not mean that I ought not aim at any limited end.  I may desire absolutely and forever a revelation of a moment.  This means that the value of this provisional end will be confirmed indefinitely.  But this living confirmation can not be merely contemplative and verbal.  It is carried out in an act.  The goal toward which I surpass myself must appear to me as a point of departure toward a new act of surpassing.  Thus, a creative freedom develops happily without ever congealing into unjustified facticity.  The creator leans upon anterior creations in order to create the possibility of new creations.  His present project embraces the past and places confidence in the freedom to come, a confidence which is never disappointed.  It discloses being at the end of a further disclosure.  At each moment freedom is confirmed through all creation.  However, man does not create the world.  He succeeds in disclosing it only through the resistance which the world opposes to him.  The will is defined only by raising obstacles, and by the contingency of facticity certain obstacles let themselves be conquered, and others do not.  This is what Descartes expressed when he said that the freedom of man is infinite, but his power is limited.  How can the presence of these limits be reconciled with the idea of a freedom confirmimg itself as a unity and an indefinite movement? In the face of an obstacle which it is impossible to overcome, stubbornness is stupid.  If I persist in beating my fist against a stone wall, my freedom exhausts itself in this useless gesture without succeeding in giving itself a content.  It debases itself in a vain contingency.  Yet, there is hardly a sadder virtue than resignation.  It transforms into phantoms and contingent reveries projects which had at the beginning been set up as will and freedom.  A young man has hoped for a happy or useful or glorious life.  If the man he has become looks upon these miscarried attempts of his adolescence with disillusioned indifference, there they are, forever frozen in the dead past.  When an effort fails, one declares bitterly that he has lost time and wasted his powers.  The failure condemns that whole part of ourselves which we had engaged in the effort.  It was to escape this dilemma that the Stoics preached indifference.  We could indeed assert our freedom against all constraint if we agreed to renounce the particularity of our projects.  If a door refuses to open, let us accept not opening it and there we are free.  But by doing that, one manages only to save an abstract notion of freedom.  It is emptied of all content and all truth.  The power of man ceases to be limited because it is annulled.  It is the particularity of the project which determines the limitation of the power, but it is also what gives the project its content and permits it to be set up.  There are people who are filled with such horror at the idea of a defeat that they keep themselves from ever doing anything.  But no one would dream of considering this gloomy passivity as the triumph of freedom.  The truth is that in order for my freedom not to risk coming to grief against the obstacle which its very engagement has raised, in order that it might still pursue its movement in the face of the failure, it must, by giving itself a particular content, aim by means of it at an end which is nothing else but precisely the free movement of existence.  Popular opinion is quite right in admiring a man who, having been ruined or having suffered an accident, knows how to gain the upper hand, that is, renew his engagement in the world, thereby strongly asserting the independence of freedom in relation to thing.  Thus, when the sick Van Gogh calmly accepted the prospect of a future in which he would be unable to paint any more, there was no sterile resignation.  For him painting was a personal way of life and of communication with others which in another form could be continued even in an asylum.  The past will be integrated and freedom will be confirmed in a renunciation of this kind.  It will be lived in both heartbreak and joy.  In heartbreak, because the project is then robbed of its particularity — it sacrifices its flesh and blood.  But in joy, since at the moment one releases his hold, he again finds his hands free and ready to stretch out toward a new future.  But this act of passing beyond is conceivable only if what the content has in view is not to bar up the future, but, on the contrary, to plan new possibilities.  This brings us back by another route to what we had already indicated.  My freedom must not seek to trap being but to disclose it.  The disclosure is the transition from being to existence.  The goal which my freedom aims at is conquering existence across the always inadequate density of being.  However, such salvation is only possible if, despite obstacles and failures, a man preserves the disposal of his future, if the situation opens up more possibilities to him.  In case his transcendence is cut off from his goal or there is no longer any hold on objects which might give it a valid content, his spontaneity is dissipated without founding anything.  Then he may not justify his existence positively and he feels its contingency with wretched disgust.  There is no more obnoxious way to punish a man than to force him to perform acts which make no sense to him, as when one empties and fills the same ditch indefinitely, when one makes soldiers who are being punished march up and down, or when one forces a schoolboy to copy lines.  Revolts broke out in Italy in September 1946 because the unemployed were set to breaking pebbles which served no purpose whatever.  As is well known, this was also the weakness which ruined the national workshops in 1848.  This mystification of useless effort is more intolerable than fatigue.  Life imprisonment is the most horrible of punishments because it preserves existence in its pure facticity but forbids it all legitimation.  A freedom can not will itself without willing itself as an indefinite movement.  It must absolutely reject the constraints which arrest its drive toward itself.  This rejection takes on a positive aspect when the constraint is natural.  One rejects the illness by curing it.  But it again assumes the negative aspect of revolt when the oppressor is a human freedom.  One can not deny being: the in-itself is, and negation has no hold over this being, this pure positivity; one does not escape this fullness: a destroyed house is a ruin; a broken chain is scrap iron: one attains only signification and, through it, the for-itself which is projected there; the for-itself carries nothingness in its heart and can be annihilated, whether in the very upsurge of its existence or through the world in which it exists.  The prison is repudiated as such when the prisoner escapes.  But revolt, insofar as it is pure negative movement, remains abstract.  It is fulfilled as freedom only by returning to the positive, that is, by giving itself a content through action, escape, political struggle, revolution.  Human transcendence then seeks, with the destruction of the given situation, the whole future which will flow from its victory.  It resumes its indefinite rapport with itself.  There are limited situations where this return to the positive is impossible, where the future is radically blocked off.  Revolt can then be achieved only in the definitive rejection of the imposed situation, in suicide.  It can be seen that, on the one hand, freedom can always save itself, for it is realized as a disclosure of existence through its very failures, and it can again confirm itself by a death freely chosen.  But, on the other hand, the situations which it discloses through its project toward itself do not appear as equivalents.  It regards as privileged situations those which permit it to realize itself as indefinite movement; that is, it wishes to pass beyond everything which limits its power; and yet, this power is always limited.  Thus, just as life is identified with the will-to-live, freedom always appears as a movement of liberation.  It is only by prolonging itself through the freedom of others that it manages to surpass death itself and to realize itself as an indefinite unity.  Later on we shall see what problems such a relationship raises.  For the time being it is enough for us to have established the fact that the words “to will oneself free” have a positive and concrete meaning.  If man wishes to save his existence, as only he himself can do, his original spontaneity must be raised to the height of moral freedom by taking itself as an end through the disclosure of a particular content.  But a new question is immediately raised.  If man has one and only one way to save his existence, how can he choose not to choose it in all cases? How is a bad willing possible? We meet with this problem in all ethics, since it is precisely the possibility of a perverted willing which gives a meaning to the idea of virtue.  We know the answer of Socrates, of Plato, of Spinoza: “No one is willfully bad.” And if Good is a transcendent thing which is more or less foreign to man, one imagines that the mistake can be explained by error.  But if one grants that the moral world is the world genuinely willed by man, all possibility of error is eliminated.  Moreover, in Kantian ethics, which is at the origin of all ethics of autonomy, it is very difficult to account for an evil will.  As the choice of his character which the subject makes is achieved in the intelligible world by a purely rational will, one can not understand how the latter expressly rejects the law which it gives to itself.  But this is because Kantism defined man as a pure positivity, and it therefore recognized no other possibility in him than coincidence with himself.  We, too, define morality by this adhesion to the self; and this is why we say that man can not positively decide between the negation and the assumption of his freedom, for as soon as he decides, he assumes it.  He can not positively will not to be free for such a willing would be self-destructive.  Only, unlike Kant, we do not see man as being essentially a positive will.  On the contrary, he is first defined as a negativity.  He is first at a distance from himself.  He can coincide with himself only by agreeing never to rejoin himself.  There is within him a perpetual playing with the negative, and he thereby escapes himself, he escapes his freedom.  And it is precisely because an evil will is here possible that the words “to will oneself free” have a meaning.  Therefore, not only do we assert that the existentialist doctrine permits the elaboration of an ethics, but it even appears to us as the only philosophy in which an ethics has its place.  For, in a metaphysics of transcendence, in the classical sense of the term, evil is reduced to error; and in humanistic philosophies it is impossible to account for it, man being defined as complete in a complete world.  Existentialism alone gives — like religions — a real role to evil, and it is this, perhaps, which make its judgments so gloomy.  Men do not like to feel themselves in danger.  Yet, it is because there are real dangers, real failures and real earthly damnation that words like victory, wisdom, or joy have meaning.  Nothing is decided in advance, and it is because man has something to lose and because he can lose that he can also win.  Therefore, in the very condition of man there enters the possibility of not fulfilling this condition.  In order to fulfill it he must assume himself as a being who “makes himself a lack of being so that there might be being.” But the trick of dishonesty permits stopping at any moment whatsoever.  One may hesitate to make oneself a lack of being, one may withdraw before existence, or one may falsely assert oneself as being, or assert oneself as nothingness.  One may realize his freedom only as an abstract independence, or, on the contrary, reject with despair the distance which separates us from being.  All errors are possible since man is a negativity, and they are motivated by the anguish he feels in the face of his freedom.  Concretely, men slide incoherently from one attitude to another.  We shall limit ourselves to describing in their abstract form those which we have just indicated.

The Antinomies of Action 4.  The Present and the Future 5.  Ambiguity Conclusion Index Cover The Ethics of Ambiguity II Man’s unhappiness, says Descartes, is due to his having first been a child.  And indeed the unfortunate choices which most men make can only be explained by the fact that they have taken place on the basis of childhood.  The child’s situation is characterized by his finding himself cast into a universe which he has not helped to establish, which has been fashioned without him, and which appears to him as an absolute to which he can only submit.  In his eyes, human inventions, words, customs, and values are given facts, as inevitable as the sky and the trees.  This means that the world in which he lives is a serious world, since the characteristic of the spirit of seriousness is to consider values as ready-made things.  That does not mean that the child himself is serious.  On the contrary, he is allowed to play, to expend his existence freely.  In his child’s circle he feels that he can passionately pursue and joyfully attain goals which he has set up for himself.  But if he fulfills this experience in all tranquillity, it is precisely because the domain open to his subjectivity seems insignificant and puerile in his own eyes.  He feels himself happily irresponsible.  The real world is that of adults where he is allowed only to respect and obey.  The naive victim of the mirage of the for-others, he believes in the being of his parents and teachers.  He takes them for the divinities which they vainly try to be and whose appearance they like to borrow before his ingenuous eyes.  Rewards, punishments, prizes, words of praise or blame instill in him the conviction that there exist a good and an evil which like a sun and a moon exist as ends in themselves.  In his universe of definite and substantial things, beneath the sovereign eyes of grown-up persons, he thinks that he too has being in a definite and substantial way.  He is a good little boy or a scamp; he enjoys being it.  If something deep inside him belies his conviction, he conceals this imperfection.  He consoles himself for an inconsistency which he attributes to his young age by pinning his hopes on the future.  Later on he too will become a big imposing statue.  While waiting, he plays at being, at being a saint, a hero, a guttersnipe.  He feels himself like those models whose images are sketched out in his books in broad, unequivocal strokes: explorer, brigand, sister of charity.  This game of being serious can take on such an importance in the child’s life that he himself actually becomes serious.  We know such children who are caricatures of adults.  Even when the joy of existing is strongest, when the child abandons himself to it, he feels himself protected against the risk of existence by the ceiling which human generations have built over his head.  And it is by virtue of this that the child’s condition (although it can be unhappy in other respects) is meta-physically privileged.  Normally the child escapes the anguish of freedom.  He can, if he likes, be recalcitrant, lazy; his whims and his faults concern only him.  They do not weigh upon the earth.  They can not make a dent in the serene order of a world which existed before him, without him, where he is in a state of security by virtue of his very insignificance.  He can do with impunity whatever he likes.  He knows that nothing can ever happen through him; everything is already given; his acts engage nothing, not even himself.  There are beings whose life slips by in an infantile world because, having been kept in a state of servitude and ignorance, they have no means of breaking the ceiling which is stretched over their heads.  Like the child, they can exercise their freedom, but only within this universe which has been set up before them, without them.  This is the case, for example, of slaves who have not raised themselves to the consciousness of their slavery.  The southern planters were not altogether in the wrong in considering the negroes who docilely submitted to their paternalism as “grown-up children.” To the extent that they respected the world of the whites the situation of the black slaves was exactly an infantile situation.  This is also the situation of women in many civilizations; they can only submit to the laws, the gods, the customs, and the truths created by the males.  Even today in western countries, among women who have not had in their work an apprenticeship of freedom, there are still many who take shelter in the shadow of men; they adopt without discussion the opinions and values recognized by their husband or their lover, and that allows them to develop childish qualities which are forbidden to adults because they are based on a feeling of irresponsibility.  If what is called women’s futility often has so much charm and grace, if it sometimes has a genuinely moving character, it is because it manifests a pure and gratuitous taste for existence, like the games of children; it is the absence of the serious.  The unfortunate thing is that in many cases this thoughtlessness, this gaiety, these charming inventions imply a deep complicity with the world of men which they seem so graciously to be contesting, and it is a mistake to be astonished, once the structure which shelters them seems to be in danger, to see sensitive, ingenuous, and light-minded women show themselves harder, more bitter, and even more furious or cruel than their masters.  It is then that we discover the difference which distinguishes them from an actual child: the child’s situation is imposed upon him, whereas the woman (I mean the western woman of today) chooses it or at least consents to it.  Ignorance and error are facts as inescapable as prison walls.  The negro slave of the eighteenth century, the Mohammedan woman enclosed in a harem have no instrument, be it in thought or by astonishment or anger, which permits them to attack the civilization which oppresses them.  Their behavior is defined and can be judged only within this given situation, and it is possible that in this situation, limited like every human situation, they realize a perfect assertion of their freedom.  But once there appears a possibility of liberation, it is resignation of freedom not to exploit the possibility, a resignation which implies dishonesty and which is a positive fault.  The fact is that it is very rare for the infantile world to maintain itself beyond adolescence.  From childhood on, flaws begin to be revealed in it.  With astonishment, revolt and disrespect the child little by little asks himself, “Why must I act that way? What good is it? And what will happen if I act in another way?” He discovers his subjectivity; he discovers that of others.  And when he arrives at the age of adolescence he begins to vacillate because he notices the contradictions among adults as well as their hesitations and weakness.  Men stop appearing as if they were gods, and at the same time the adolescent discovers the human character of the reality about him.  Language, customs, ethics, and values have their source in these uncertain creatures.  The moment has come when he too is going to be called upon to participate in their operation; his acts weigh upon the earth as much as those of other men.  He will have to choose and decide.  It is comprehensible that it is hard for him to live this moment of his history, and this is doubtless the deepest reason for the crisis of adolescence; the individual must at last assume his subjectivity.  From one point of view the collapsing of the serious world is a deliverance.  Although he was irresponsible, the child also felt himself defenseless before obscure powers which directed the course of things.  But whatever the joy of this liberation may be, it is not without great confusion that the adolescent finds himself cast into a world which is no longer ready-made, which has to be made; he is abandoned, unjustified, the prey of a freedom that is no longer chained up by anything.  What will he do in the face of this new situation? This is the moment when he decides.  If what might be called the natural history of an individual, his affective complexes, etcetera depend above all upon his childhood, it is adolescence which appears as the moment of moral choice.  Freedom is then revealed and he must decide upon his attitude in the face of it.  Doubtless, this decision can always be reconsidered, but the fact is that conversions are difficult because the world reflects back upon us a choice which is confirmed through this world which it has fashioned.  Thus, a more and more rigorous circle is formed from which one is more and more unlikely to escape.  Therefore, the misfortune which comes to man as a result of the fact that he was a child is that his freedom was first concealed from him and that all his life he will be nostalgic for the time when he did not know its exigencies.  This misfortune has still another aspect.  Moral choice is free, and therefore unforeseeable.  The child does not contain the man he will become.  Yet, it is always on the basis of what he has been that a man decides upon what he wants to be.  He draws the motivations of his moral attitude from within the character which he has given himself and from within the universe which is its correlative.  Now, the child set up this character and this universe little by little, without foreseeing its development.  He was ignorant of the disturbing aspect of this freedom which he was heedlessly exercising.  He tranquilly abandoned himself to whims, laughter, tears, and anger which seemed to him to have no morrow and no danger, and yet which left ineffaceable imprints about him.  The drama of original choice is that it goes on moment by moment for an entire lifetime, that it occurs without reason, before any reason, that freedom is there as if it were present only in the form of contingency.  This contingency recalls, in a way, the arbitrariness of the grace distributed by God in Calvinistic doctrine.  Here too there is a sort of predestination issuing not from an external tyranny but from the operation of the subject itself.  Only, we think that man has always a possible recourse to himself.  There is no choice so unfortunate that he cannot be saved.  It is in this moment of justification — a moment which extends throughout his whole adult life — that the attitude of man is placed on a moral plane.  The contingent spontaneity can not be judged in the name of freedom.  Yet a child already arouses sympathy or antipathy.  Every man casts himself into the world by making himself a lack of being; he thereby contributes to reinvesting it with human signification.  He discloses it.  And in this movement even the most outcast sometimes feel the joy of existing.  They then manifest existence as a happiness and the world as a source of joy.  But it is up to each one to make himself a lack of more or less various, profound, and rich aspects of being.  What is called vitality, sensitivity, and intelligence are not ready-made qualities, but a way of casting oneself into the world and of disclosing being.  Doubtless, every one casts himself into it on the basis of his physiological possibilities, but the body itself is not a brute fact.  It expresses our relationship to the world, and that is why it is an object of sympathy or repulsion.  And on the other hand, it determines no behavior.  There is vitality only by means of free generosity.  Intelligence supposes good will, and, inversely, a man is never stupid if he adapts his language and his behavior to his capacities, and sensitivity is nothing else but the presence which is attentive to the world and to itself.  The reward for these spontaneous qualities issues from the fact that they make significances and goals appear in the world.  They discover reasons for existing.  They confirm us in the pride and joy of our destiny as man.  To the extent that they subsist in an individual they still arouse sympathy, even if he has made himself hateful by the meaning which he has given to his life.  I have heard it said that at the Nuremberg trial Goering exerted a certain seductive power on his judges because of the vitality which emanated from him.  If we were to try to establish a kind of hierarchy among men, we would put those who are denuded of this living warmth — the tepidity which the Gospel speaks of — on the lowest rung of the ladder.  To exist is to make oneself a lack of being; it is to cast oneself into the world.  Those who occupy themselves in restraining this original movement can be considered as sub-men.  They have eyes and ears, but from their childhood on they make themselves blind and deaf, without love and without desire.  This apathy manifests a fundamental fear in the face of existence, in the face of the risks and tensions which it implies.  The sub-man rejects this “passion” which is his human condition, the laceration and the failure of that drive toward being which always misses its goal, but which thereby is the very existence which he rejects.  Such a choice immediately confirms itself.  Just as a bad painter, by a single movement, paints bad paintings and is satisfied with them, whereas in a work of value the artist immediately recognizes the demand of a higher sort of work, in like fashion the original poverty of his project exempts the sub-man from seeking to legitimize it.  He discovers around him only an insignificant and dull world.  How could this naked world arouse within him any desire to feel, to understand, to live? The less he exists, the less is there reason for him to exist, since these reasons are created only by existing.  Yet, he exists.  By the fact of transcending himself he indicates certain goals, he circumscribes certain values.  But he at once effaces these uncertain shadows.  His whole behavior tends toward an elimination of their ends.  By the incoherence of his plans, by his haphazard whims, or by his indifference, he reduces to nothingness the meaning of his surpassing.  His acts are never positive choices, only flights.  He can not prevent himself from being a presence in the world, but he maintains this presence on the plane of bare facticity.  However, if a man were permitted to be a brute fact, he would merge with the trees and pebbles which are not aware that they exist; we would consider these opaque lives with indifference.  But the sub-man arouses contempt, that is, one recognizes him to be responsible for himself at the moment that one accuses him of not willing himself.  The fact is that no man is a datum which is passively suffered; the rejection of existence is still another way of existing; nobody can know the peace of the tomb while he is alive.  There we have the defeat of the sub-man.  He would like to forget himself, to be ignorant of himself, but the nothingness which is at the heart of man is also the consciousness that he has of himself.  His negativity is revealed positively as anguish, desire, appeal, laceration, but as for the genuine return to the positive, the sub-man eludes it.  He is afraid of engaging himself in a project as he is afraid of being disengaged and thereby of being in a state of danger before the future, in the midst of its possibilities.  He is thereby led to take refuge in the ready-made values of the serious world.  He will proclaim certain opinions; he will take shelter behind a label; and to hide his indifference he will readily abandon himself to verbal outbursts or even physical violence.  One day, a monarchist, the next day, an anarchist, he is more readily anti-semitic, anti-clerical, or anti-republican.  Thus, though we have defined him as a denial and a flight, the sub-man is not a harmless creature.  He realizes himself in the world as a blind uncontrolled force which anybody can get control of.  In lynchings, in pogroms, in all the great bloody movements organized by the fanaticism of seriousness and passion, movements where there is no risk, those who do the actual dirty work are recruited from among the sub-men.  That is why every man who wills himself free within a human world fashioned by free men will be so disgusted by the sub-men.  Ethics is the triumph of freedom over facticity, and the sub-man feels only the facticity of his existence.  Instead of aggrandizing the reign of the human, he opposes his inert resistance to the projects of other men.  No project has meaning in the world disclosed by such an existence.  Man is defined as a wild flight.  The world about him is bare and incoherent.  Nothing ever happens; nothing merits desire or effort.  The sub-man makes his way across a world deprived of meaning toward a death which merely confirms his long negation of himself.  The only thing revealed in this experience is the absurd facticity of an existence which remains forever unjustified if it has not known how to justify itself.  The sub-man experiences the desert of the world in his boredom.  And the strange character of a universe with which he has created no bond also arouses fear in him.  Weighted down by present events, he is bewildered before the darkness of the future which is haunted by frightful specters, war, sickness, revolution, fascism, bolshevism.  The more indistinct these dangers are, the more fearful they become.  The sub-man is not very clear about what he has to lose, since he has nothing, but this very uncertainty re-enforces his terror.  Indeed, what he fears is that the shock of the unforeseen may remind him of the agonizing consciousness of himself.  Thus, fundamental as a man’s fear in the face of existence may be, though he has chosen from his earliest years to deny his presence in the world, he can not keep himself from existing, he can not efface the agonizing evidence of his freedom.  That is why, as we have just seen, in order to get rid of his freedom, he is led to engage it positively.  The attitude of the sub-man passes logically over into that of the serious man; he forces himself to submerge his freedom in the content which the latter accepts from society.  He loses himself in the object in order to annihilate his subjectivity.  This certitude has been described so frequently that it will not be necessary to consider it at length.  Hegel has spoken of it ironically.  In The Phenomenology of Mind he has shown that the sub-man plays the part of the inessential in the face of the object which is considered as the essential.  He suppresses himself to the advantage of the Thing, which, sanctified by respect, appears in the form of a Cause, science, philosophy, revolution, etc.  But the truth is that this ruse miscarries, for the Cause can not save the individual insofar as he is a concrete and separate existence.  After Hegel, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also railed at the deceitful stupidity of the serious man and his universe.  And Being and Nothingness is in large part a description of the serious man and his universe.  The serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned.  He imagines that the accession to these values likewise permanently confers value upon himself.  Shielded with “rights,” he fulfills himself as a being who is escaping from the stress of existence.  The serious is not defined by the nature of the ends pursued.  A frivolous lady of fashion can have this mentality of the serious as well as an engineer.  There is the serious from the moment that freedom denies itself to the advantage of ends which one claims are absolute.  Since all of this is well known, I should like to make only a few remarks in this place.  It is easily understood why, of all the attitudes which are not genuine, the latter is the most widespread; because every man was first a child.  After having lived under the eyes of the gods, having been given the promise of divinity, one does not readily accept becoming simply a man with all his anxiety and doubt.  What is to be done? What is to be believed? Often the young man, who has not, like the sub-man, first rejected existence, so that these questions are not even raised, is nevertheless frightened at having to answer them.  After a more or less long crisis, either he turns back toward the world of his parents and teachers or he adheres to the values which are new but seem to him just as sure.  Instead of assuming an affectivity which would throw him dangerously beyond himself, he represses it.  Liquidation, in its classic form of transference and sublimation, is the passage from the affective to the serious in the propitious shadow of dishonesty.  The thing that matters to the serious man is not so much the nature of the object which he prefers to himself, but rather the fact of being able to lose himself in it.  So much so, that the movement toward the object is, in fact, through his arbitrary act the most radical assertion of subjectivity: to believe for belief’s sake, to will for will’s sake is, detaching transcendence from its end, to realize one’s freedom in its empty and absurd form of freedom of indifference.  The serious man’s dishonesty issues from his being obliged ceaselessly to renew the denial of this freedom.  He chooses to live in an infantile world, but to the child the values are really given.  The serious man must mask the movement by which he gives them to himself, like the mythomaniac who while reading a love-letter pretends to forget that she has sent it to herself.  We have already pointed out that certain adults can live in the universe of the serious in all honesty, for example, those who are denied all instruments of escape, those who are enslaved or who are mystified.  The less economic and social circumstances allow an individual to act upon the world, the more this world appears to him as given.  This is the case of women who inherit a long tradition of submission and of those who are called “the humble.” There is often laziness and timidity in their resignation; their honesty is not quite complete; but to the extent that it exists, their freedom remains available, it is not denied.  They can, in their situation of ignorant and powerless individuals, know the truth of existence and raise themselves to a properly moral life.  It even happens that they turn the freedom which they have thus won against the very object of their respect; thus, in A Doll’s House, the childlike naivete of the heroine leads her to rebel against the lie of the serious.  On the contrary, the man who has the necessary instruments to escape this lie and who does not want to use them consumes his freedom in denying them.  He makes himself serious.  He dissimulates his subjectivity under the shield of rights which emanate from the ethical universe recognized by him; he is no longer a man, but a father, a boss, a member of the Christian Church or the Communist Party.  If one denies the subjective tension of freedom one is evidently forbidding himself universally to will freedom in an indefinite movement.  By virtue of the fact that he refuses to recognize that he is freely establishing the value of the end he sets up, the serious man makes himself the slave of that end.  He forgets that every goal is at the same time a point of departure and that human freedom is the ultimate, the unique end to which man should destine himself.  He accords an absolute meaning to the epithet useful, which, in truth, has no more meaning if taken by itself than the words high, low, right, and left.  It simply designates a relationship and requires a complement: useful for this or that.  The complement itself must be put into question, and, as we shall see later on, the whole problem of action is then raised.  But the serious man puts nothing into question.  For the military man, the army is useful; for the colonial administrator, the highway; for the serious revolutionary, the revolution — army, highway, revolution, productions becoming inhuman idols to which one will not hesitate to sacrifice man himself.  Therefore, the serious man is dangerous.  It is natural that he makes himself a tyrant.  Dishonestly ignoring the subjectivity of his choice, he pretends that the unconditioned value of the object is being asserted through him; and by the same token he also ignores the value of the subjectivity and the freedom of others, to such an extent that, sacrificing them to the thing, he persuades himself that what he sacrifices is nothing.  The colonial administrator who has raised the highway to the stature of an idol will have no scruple about assuring its construction at the price of a great number of lives of the natives; for, what value has the life of a native who is incompetent, lazy, and clumsy when it comes to building highways? The serious leads to a fanaticism which is as formidable as the fanaticism of passion.  It is the fanaticism of the Inquisition which does not hesitate to impose a credo, that is, an internal movement, by means of external constraints.  It is the fanaticism of the Vigilantes of America who defend morality by means of lynchings.  it is the political fanaticism which empties politics of all human content and imposes the State, not for individuals, but against them.  In order to justify the contradictory, absurd, and outrageous aspects of this kind of behavior, the serious man readily takes refuge in disputing the serious, but it is the serious of others which he disputes, not his own.  Thus, the colonial administrator is not unaware of the trick of irony.  He contests the importance of the happiness, the comfort, the very life of the native, but he reveres the Highway, the Economy, the French Empire; he reveres himself as a servant of these divinities.  Almost all serious men cultivate an expedient levity; we are familiar with the genuine gaiety of Catholics, the fascist “sense of humor.” There are also some who do not even feel the need for such a weapon.  They hide from themselves the incoherence of their choice by taking flight.  As soon as the Idol is no longer concerned, the serious man slips into the attitude of the sub-man.  He keeps himself from existing because he is not capable of existing without a guarantee.  Proust observed with astonishment that a great doctor or a great professor often shows himself, outside of his specialty, to be lacking in sensitivity, intelligence, and humanity.  The reason for this is that having abdicated his freedom, he has nothing else left but his techniques.  In domains where his techniques are not applicable, he either adheres to the most ordinary of values or fulfills himself as a flight.  The serious man stubbornly engulfs his transcendence in the object which bars the horizon and bolts the sky.  The rest of the world is a faceless desert.  Here again one sees how such a choice is immediately confirmed.  If there is being only, for example, in the form of the Army, how could the military man wish for anything else than to multiply barracks and maneuvers? No appeal rises from the abandoned zones where nothing can be reaped because nothing has been sown.  As soon as he leaves the staff, the old general becomes dull.  That is why the serious man’s life loses all meaning if he finds himself cut off from his ends.  Ordinarily, he does not put all his eggs into one basket, but if it happens that a failure or old age ruins all his justifications, then, unless there is a conversion, which is always possible, he no longer has any relief except in flight; ruined, dishonored, this important personage is now only a “has-been.” He joins the sub-man, unless by suicide he once and for all puts an end to the agony of his freedom.  It is in a state of fear that the serious man feels this dependence upon the object; and the first of virtues, in his eyes, is prudence.  He escapes the anguish of freedom only to fall into a state of preoccupation, of worry.  Everything is a threat to him, since the thing which he has set up as an idol is an externality and is thus in relationship with the whole universe and consequently threatened by the whole universe; and since, despite all precautions, he will never be the master of this exterior world to which he has consented to submit, he will be constantly upset by the uncontrollable course of events.  He will always be saying that he is disappointed, for his wish to have the world harden into a thing is belied by the very movement of life.  The future will contest his present successes; his children will disobey him, his will will be opposed by those of strangers; he will be a prey to illhumor and bitterness.  His very successes have a taste of ashes, for the serious is one of those ways of trying to realize the impossible synthesis of the in-itself and the foritself.  The serious man wills himself to be a god; but he is not one and knows it.  He wishes to rid himself of his subjectivity, but it constantly risks being unmasked; it is unmasked.  Transcending all goals, reflection wonders, “What’s the use?” There then blazes forth the absurdity of a life which has sought outside of itself the justifications which it alone could give itself.  Detached from the freedom which might have genuinely grounded them, all the ends that have been pursued appear arbitrary and useless.  This failure of the serious sometimes brings about a radical disorder.  Conscious of being unable to be anything, man then decides to be nothing.  We shall call this attitude nihilistic.  The nihilist is close to the spirit of seriousness, for instead of realizing his negativity as a living movement, he conceives his annihilation in a substantial way.  He wants to be nothing, and this nothing that he dreams of is still another sort of being, the exact Hegelian antithesis of being, a stationary datum.  Nihilism is disappointed seriousness which has turned back upon itself.  A choice of this kind is not encountered among those who, feeling the joy of existence, assume its gratuity.  It appears either at the moment of adolescence, when the individual, seeing his child’s universe flow away, feels the lack which is in his heart, or, later on, when the attempts to fulfill himself as a being have failed; in any case, among men who wish to rid themselves of the anxiety of their freedom by denying the world and themselves.  By this rejection, they draw near to the sub-man.  The difference is that their withdrawal is not their original movement.  At first, they cast themselves into the world, sometimes even with a largeness of spirit.  They exist and they know it.  It sometimes happens that, in his state of deception, a man maintains a sort of affection for the serious world; this is how Sartre describes Baudelaire in his study of the poet.  Baudelaire felt a burning rancor in regard to the values of his childhood, but this rancor still involved some respect.  Scorn alone liberated him.  It was necessary for him that the universe which he rejected continue in order for him to detest it and scoff at it; it is the attitude of the demoniacal man as Jouhandeau has also described him: one stubbornly maintains the values of childhood, of a society, or of a Church in order to be able to trample upon them.  The demoniacal man is still very close to the serious; he wants to believe in it; he confirms it by his very revolt; he feels himself as a negation and a freedom, but he does not realize this freedom as a positive liberation.  One can go much further in rejection by occupying himself not in scorning but in annihilating the rejected world and himself along with it.  For example, the man who gives himself to a cause which he knows to be lost chooses to merge the world with one of its aspects which carries within it the germ of its ruin, involving himself in this condemned universe and condemning himself with it.  Another man devotes his time and energy to an under-taking which was not doomed to failure at the start but which he himself is bent on ruining.  Still another rejects each of his projects one after the other, frittering them away in a series of caprices and thereby systematically annuling the ends which he is aiming at.  The constant negation of the word by the word, of the act by the act, of art by art was realized by Dadaist incoherence.  By following a strict injunction to commit disorder and anarchy, one achieved the abolition of all behavior, and therefore of all ends and of oneself.  But this will to negation is forever belying itself, for it manifests itself as a presence at the very moment that it displays itself.  It therefore implies a constant tension, inversely symmetrical with the existential and more painful tension, for if it is true that man is not, it is also true that he exists, and in order to realize his negativity positively he will have to contradict constantly the movement of existence.  If one does not resign himself to suicide one slips easily into a more stable attitude than the shrill rejection of nihilism.  Surrealism provides us with a historical and concrete example of different possible kinds of evolution.  Certain initiates, such as Vache and Crevel, had recourse to the radical solution of suicide.  Others destroyed their bodies and ruined their minds by drugs.  Other succeeded in a sort of moral suicide; by dint of depopulating the world around them, they found themselves in a desert, with themselves reduced to the level of the sub-man; they no longer try to flee, they are fleeing.  There are also some who have again sought out the security of the serious.  They have reformed, arbitrarily choosing marriage, politics, or religion as refuges.  Even the surrealists who have wanted to remain faithful to themselves have been unable to avoid returning to the positive, to the serious.  The negation of aesthetic, spiritual, and moral values has become an ethics; unruliness has become a rule.  We have been present at the establishment of a new Church, with its dogmas, its rites, its faithful, its priests, and even its martyrs; today, there is nothing of the destroyer in Breton; he is a pope.  And as every assassination of painting is still a painting, a lot of surrealists have found themselves the authors of positive works; their revolt has become the matter on which their career has been built.  Finally, some of them, in a genuine return to the positive, have been able to realize their freedom; they have given it a content without disavowing it.  They have engaged themselves, without losing themselves, in political action, in intellectual or artistic research, in family or social life.  The attitude of the nihilist can perpetuate itself as such only if it reveals itself as a positivity at its very core.  Rejecting his own existence, the nihilist must also reject the existences which confirm it.  If he wills himself to be nothing, all mankind must also be annihilated; otherwise, by means of the presence of this world that the Other reveals he meets himself as a presence in the world.  But this thirst for destruction immediately takes the form of a desire for power.  The taste of nothingness joins the original taste of being whereby every man is first defined; he realizes himself as a being by making himself that by which nothingness comes into the world.  Thus, Nazism was both a will for power and a will for suicide at the same time.  From a historical point of view, Nazism has many other features besides; in particular, beside the dark romanticism which led Rauschning to entitle his work The Revolution of Nihilism, we also find a gloomy seriousness.  The fact is that Nazism was in the service of petit bourgeois seriousness.  But it is interesting to note that its ideology did not make this alliance impossible, for the serious often rallies to a partial nihilism, denying everything which is not its object in order to hide from itself the antinomies of action.  A rather pure example of this impassioned nihilism is the well-known case of Drieu la Rochelle.  The Empty Suitcase is the testimony of a young man who acutely felt the fact of existing as a lack of being, of not being.  This is a genuine experience on the basis of which the only possible salvation is to assume the lack, to side with the man who exists against the idea of a God who does not.  On the contrary — a novel like Gilles is proof — Drieu stubbornly persisted in his deception.  In his hatred of himself he chose to reject his condition as a man, and this led him to hate all men along with himself.  Gilles knows satisfaction only when he fires on Spanish workers and sees the flow of blood which he compares to the redeeming blood of Christ; as if the only salvation by man were the death of other men, whereby perfect negation is achieved.  It is natural that this path ended in collaboration, the ruin of a detested world being merged for Drieu with the annulment of himself.  An external failure led him to give to his life a conclusion which it called for dialectically: suicide.  The nihilist attitude manifests a certain truth.  In this attitude one experiences the ambiguity of the human condition.  But the mistake is that it defines man not as the positive existence of a lack, but as a lack at the heart of existence, whereas the truth is that existence is not a lack as such.  And if freedom is experienced in this case in the form of rejection, it is not genuinely fulfilled.  The nihilist is right in thinking that the world possesses no justification and that he himself is nothing.  But he forgets that it is up to him to justify the world and to make himself exist validly.  Instead of integrating death into life, he.  sees in it the only truth of the life which appears to him as a disguised death.  However, there is life, and the nihilist knows that he is alive.  That’s where his failure lies.  He rejects existence without managing to eliminate it.  He denies any meaning to his transcendence, and yet he transcends himself.  A man who delights in freedom can find an ally in the nihilist because they contest the serious world together, but he also sees in him an enemy insofar as the nihilist is a systematic rejection of the world and man, and if this rejection ends up in a positive desire for destruction, it then establishes a tyranny which freedom must stand up against.  The fundamental fault of the nihilist is that, challenging all given values, he does not find, beyond their ruin, the importance of that universal, absolute end which freedom itself is.  It is possible that, even in this failure, a man may nevertheless keep his taste for an existence which he originally felt as a joy.  Hoping for no justification, he will nevertheless take delight in living.  He will not turn aside from things which he does not believe in.  He will seek a pretext in them for a gratuitous display of activity.  Such a man is what is generally called an adventurer.  He throws himself into his undertakings with zest, into exploration, conquest, war, speculation, love, politics, but he does not attach himself to the end at which he aims; only to his conquest.  He likes action for its own sake.  He finds joy in spreading through the world a freedom which remains indifferent to its content.  Whether the taste for adventure appears to be based on nihilistic despair or whether it is born directly from the experience of the happy days of childhood, it always implies that freedom is realized as an independence in regard to the serious world and that, on the other hand, the ambiguity of existence is felt not as a lack but in its positive aspect.  This attitude dialectically envelops nihilism’s opposition to the serious and the opposition to nihilism by existence as such.  But, of course, the concrete history of an individual does not necessarily espouse this dialectic, by virtue of the fact that his condition is wholly present to him at each moment and because his freedom before it is, at every moment, total.  From the time of his adolescence a man can define himself as an adventurer.  The union of an original, abundant vitality and a reflective scepticism will particularly lead to this choice.  It is obvious that this choice is very close to a genuinely moral attitude.  The adventurer does not propose to be; he deliberately makes himself a lack of being; he aims expressly at existence; though engaged in his undertaking, he is at the same time detached from the goal.  Whether he succeeds or fails, he goes right ahead throwing himself into a new enterprise to which he will give himself with the same indifferent ardor.  It is not from things that he expects the justification of his choices.  Considering such behavior at the moment of its subjectivity, we see that it conforms to the requirements of ethics, and if existentialism were solipsistic, as is generally claimed, it would have to regard the adventurer as its perfect hero.  First of all, it should be noticed that the adventurer’s attitude is not always pure.  Behind the appearance of caprice, there are many men who pursue a secret goal in utter seriousness; for example, fortune or glory.  They proclaim their scepticism in regard to recognized values.  They do not take politics seriously.  They thereby allow themselves to be collaborationists in ‘41 and communists in ‘45, and it is true they don’t give a hang about the interests of the French people or the proletariat; they are attached to their career, to their success.  This arrivisme is at the very antipodes of the spirit of adventure, because the zest for existence is then never experienced in its gratuity.  It also happens that the genuine love for adventure is inextricably mixed with an attachment to the values of the serious.  Cortez and the conquistadores served God and the emperor by serving their own pleasure.  Adventure can also be shot through with passion.  The taste for conquest is often subtly tied up with the taste for possession.  Was seduction all that Don Juan liked? Did he not also like women? Or was he not even looking for a woman capable of satisfying him? But even if we consider adventure in its purity, it appears to us to be satisfying only at a subjective moment, which, in fact, is a quite abstract moment.  The adventurer always meets others along the way; the conquistador meets the Indians; the condottiere hacks out a path through blood and ruins; the explorer has comrades about him or soldiers under his orders; every Don Juan is confronted with Elviras.  Every undertaking unfolds in a human world and affects men.  What distinguishes adventure from a simple game is that the adventurer does not limit himself to asserting his existence in solitary fashion.  He asserts it in relationship to other existences.  He has to declare himself.  Two attitudes are possible.  He can become conscious of the real requirements of his own freedom, which can will itself only by destining itself to an open future, by seeking to extend itself by means of the freedom of others.  Therefore, in any case, the freedom of other men must be respected and they must be helped to free themselves.  Such a law imposes limits upon action and at the same time immediately gives it a content.  Beyond the rejected seriousness is found a genuine seriousness.  But the man who acts in this way, whose end is the liberation of himself and others, who forces himself to respect this end through the means which he uses to attain it, no longer deserves the name of adventurer.  One would not dream for example, of applying it to a Lawrence, who was so concerned about the lives of his companions and the freedom of others, so tormented by the human problems which all action raises.  One is then in the presence of a genuinely free man.  The man we call an adventurer, on the contrary, is one who remains indifferent to the content, that is, to the human meaning of his action, who thinks he can assert his own existence without taking into account that of others.  The fate of Italy mattered very little to the Italian condottiere; the massacres of the Indians meant nothing to Pizarro; Don Juan was unaffected by Elvira’s tears.  Indifferent to the ends they set up for themselves, they were still more indifferent to the means of attaining them; they cared only for their pleasure or their glory.  This implies that the adventurer shares the nihilist’s contempt for men.  And it is by this very contempt that he believes he breaks away from the contemptible condition in which those who do not imitate his pride are stagnating.  Thus, nothing prevents him from sacrificing these insignificant beings to his own will for power.  He will treat them like instruments; he will destroy them if they get in his way.  But meanwhile he appears as an enemy in the eyes of others.  His undertaking is not only an individual wager; it is a combat.  He can not win the game without making himself a tyrant or a hangman.  And as he can not impose this tyranny without help, he is obliged to serve the regime which will allow him to exercise it.  He needs money, arms, soldiers, or the support of the police and the laws.  It is not a matter of chance, but a dialectical necessity which leads the adventurer to be complacent regarding all regimes which defend the privilege of a class or a party, and more particularly authoritarian regimes and fascism.  He needs fortune, leisure, and enjoyment, and he will take these goods as supreme ends in order to be prepared to remain free in regard to any end.  Thus, confusing a quite external availability with real freedom, he falls, with a pretext of independence, into the servitude of the object.  He will range himself on the side of the regimes which guarantee him his privileges, and he will prefer those which confirm him in his contempt regarding the common herd.  He will make himself its accomplice, its servant, or even its valet, alienating a freedom which, in reality, can not confirm itself as such if it does not wear its own face.  In order to have wanted to limit it to itself, in order to have emptied it of all concrete content, he realizes it only as an abstract independence which turns into servitude.  He must submit to masters unless he makes himself the supreme master.  Favorable circumstances are enough to transform the adventurer into a dictator.  He carries the seed of one within him, since he regards mankind as indifferent matter destined to support the game of his existence.  But what he then knows is the supreme servitude of tyranny.  Hegel’s criticism of the tyrant is applicable to the adventurer to the extent that he is himself a tyrant, or at the very least an accomplice of the oppressor.  No man can save himself alone.  Doubtless, in the very heat of an action the adventurer can know a joy which is sufficient unto itself, but once the undertaking is over and has congealed behind him into a thing, it must, in order to remain alive, be animated anew by a human intention which must transcend it toward the future into recognition or admiration.  When he dies, the adventurer will be surrendering his whole life into the hands of men; the only meaning it will have will be the one they confer upon it.  He knows this since he talks about himself, often in books.  For want of a work, many desire to bequeath their own personality to posterity: at least during their lifetime they need the approval of a few faithful.  Forgotten and detested, the adventurer loses the taste for his own existence.  Perhaps without his knowing it, it seems so precious to him because of others.  It willed itself to be an affirmation, an example to all mankind.  Once it falls back upon itself, it becomes futile and unjustified.  Thus, the adventurer devises a sort of moral behavior because he assumes his subjectivity positively.  But if he dishonestly refuses to recognize that this subjectivity necessarily transcends itself toward others, he will enclose himself in a false independence which will indeed be servitude.  To the free man he will be only a chance ally in whom one can have no confidence; he will easily become an enemy.  His fault is believing that one can do something for oneself without others and even against them.  The passionate man is, in a way, the antithesis of the adventurer.  In him too there is a sketch of the synthesis of freedom and its content.  But in the adventurer it is the content which does not succeed in being genuinely fulfilled.  Whereas in the passionate man it is subjectivity which fails to fulfill itself genuinely.  What characterizes the passionate man is that he sets up the object as an absolute, not, like the serious man, as a thing detached from himself, but as a thing disclosed by his subjectivity.  There are transitions between the serious and passion.  A goal which was first willed in the name of the serious can become an object of passion; inversely, a passionate attachment can wither into a serious relationship.  But real passion asserts the subjectivity of its involvement.  In amorous passion particularly, one does not want the beloved being to be admired objectively; one prefers to think her unknown, unrecognized; the lover thinks that his appropriation of her is greater if he is alone in revealing her worth.  That is the genuine thing offered by all passion.  The moment of subjectivity therein vividly asserts itself, in its positive form, in a movement toward the object.  It is only when passion has been degraded to an organic need that it ceases to choose itself.  But as long as it remains alive it does so because subjectivity is animating it; if not pride, at least complacency and obstinacy.  At the same time that it is an assumption of this subjectivity, it is also a disclosure of being.  It helps populate the world with desirable objects, with exciting meanings.  However, in the passions which we shall call maniacal, to distinguish them from the generous passions, freedom does not find its genuine form.  The passionate man seeks possession; he seeks to attain being.  The failure and the hell which he creates for himself have been described often enough.  He causes certain rare treasures to appear in the world, but he also depopulates it.  Nothing exists outside of his stubborn project; therefore nothing can induce him to modify his choices.  And having involved his whole life with an external object which can continually escape him, he tragically feels his dependence.  Even if it does not definitely disappear, the object never gives itself.  The passionate man makes himself a lack of being not that there might be being, but in order to be.  And he remains at a distance; he is never fulfilled.  That is why though the passionate man inspires a certain admiration, he also inspires a kind of horror at the same time.  One admires the pride of a subjectivity which chooses its end without bending itself to any foreign law and the precious brilliance of the object revealed by the force of this assertion.  But one also considers the solitude in which this subjectivity encloses itself as injurious.  Having withdrawn into an unusual region of the world, seeking not to communicate with other men, this freedom is realized only as a separation.  Any conversation, any relationship with the passionate man is impossible.  In the eyes of those who desire a communion of freedom, he therefore appears as a stranger, an obstacle.  He opposes an opaque resistance to the movement of freedom which wills itself infinite.  The passionate man is not only an inert facticity.  He too is on the way to tyranny.  He knows that his will emanates only from him, but he can nevertheless attempt to impose it upon others.  He authorizes himself to do that by a partial nihilism.  Only the object of his passion appears real and full to him.  All the rest are insignificant.  Why not betray, kill, grow violent? It is never nothing that one destroys.  The whole universe is perceived only as an ensemble of means or obstacles through which it is a matter of attaining the thing in which one has engaged his being.  Not intending his freedom for men, the passionate man does not recognize them as freedoms either.  He will not hesitate to treat them as things.  If the object of his passion concerns the world in general, this tyranny becomes fanaticism.  In all fanatical movements there exists an element of the serious.  The values invented by certain men in a passion of hatred, fear, or faith are thought and willed by others as given realities.  But there is no serious fanaticism which does not have a passional base, since all adhesion to the serious world is brought about by repressed tendencies and complexes.  Thus, maniacal passion represents a damnation for the one who chooses it, and for other men it is one of the forms of separation which disunites freedoms.  It leads to struggle and oppression.  A man who seeks being far from other men, seeks it against them at the same time that he loses himself.  Yet, a conversion can start within passion itself.  The cause of the passionate man’s torment is his distance from the object; but he must accept it instead of trying to eliminate it.  It is the condition within which the object is disclosed.  The individual will then find his joy in the very wrench which separates him from the being of which he makes himself a lack.  Thus, in the letters of Made-moiselle de Lespinasse there is constant passing from grief to the assumption of this grief.  The lover describes her tears and her tortures, but she asserts that she loves this unhappiness.  It is also a source of delight for her.  She likes the other to appear as another through her separation.  It pleases her to exalt, by her very suffering, that strange existence which she chooses to set up as worthy of any sacrifice.  It is only as something strange, forbidden, as something free, that the other is revealed as an other.  And to love him genuinely is to love him in his otherness and in that freedom by which he escapes.  Love is then renunciation of all possession, of all confusion.  One renounces being in order that there may be that being which one is not.  Such generosity, moreover, can not be exercised on behalf of any object whatsoever.  One can not love a pure thing in its independence and its separation, for the thing does not have positive independence.  If a man prefers the land he has discovered to the possession of this land, a painting or a statue to their material presence, it is insofar as they appear to him as possibilities open to other men.  Passion is converted to genuine freedom only if one destines his existence to other existences through the being — whether thing or man — at which he aims, without hoping to entrap it in the destiny of the in-itself.  Thus, we see that no existence can be validly fulfilled if it is limited to itself.  It appeals to the existence of others.  The idea of such a dependence is frightening, and the separation and multiplicity of existants raises highly disturbing problems.  One can understand that men who are aware of the risks and the inevitable element of failure involved in any engagement in the world attempt to fulfill themselves outside of the world.  Man is permitted to separate himself from this world by contemplation, to think about it, to create it anew.  Some men, instead of building their existence upon the indefinite unfolding of time, propose to assert it in its eternal aspect and to achieve it as an absolute.  They hope, thereby, to surmount the ambiguity of their condition.  Thus, many intellectuals seek their salvation either in critical thought or creative activity.  We have seen that the serious contradicts itself by the fact that not everything can be taken seriously.  It slips into a partial nihilism.  But nihilism is unstable.  It tends to return to the positive.  Critical thought attempts to militate everywhere against all aspects of the serious but without foundering in the anguish of pure negation.  It sets up a superior, universal, and timeless value, objective truth.  And, correlatively, the critic defines himself positively as the independence of the mind.  Crystallizing the negative movement of the criticism of values into a positive reality, he also crystallizes the negativity proper to all mind into a positive presence.  Thus, he thinks that he himself escapes all earthly criticism.  He does not have to choose between the highway and the native, between America and Russia, between production and freedom.  He understands, dominates, and rejects, in the name of total truth, the necessarily partial truths which every human engagement discloses.  But ambiguity is at the heart of his very attitude, for the independent man is still a man with his particular situation in the world, and what he defines as objective truth is the object of his own choice.  His criticisms fall into the world of particular men.  He docs not merely describe.  He takes sides.  If he does not assume the subjectivity of his judgment, he is inevitably caught in the trap of the serious.  Instead of the independent mind he claims to be, he is only the shameful servant of a cause to which he has not chosen to rally.  The artist and the writer force themselves to surmount existence in another way.  They attempt to realize it as an absolute.  What makes their effort genuine is that they do not propose to attain being.  They distinguish themselves thereby from an engineer or a maniac.  It is existence which they are trying to pin down and make eternal.  The word, the stroke, the very marble indicate the object insofar as it is an absence.  Only, in the work of art the lack of being returns to the positive.  Time is stopped, clear forms and finished meanings rise up.  In this return, existence is confirmed and establishes its own justification.  This is what Kant said when he defined art as “a finality without end.” By virtue of the fact that he has thus set up an absolute object, the creator is then tempted to consider himself as absolute.  He justifies the world and therefore thinks he has no need of anyone to justify himself.  If the work becomes an idol whereby the artist thinks that he is fulfilling himself as being, he is closing himself up in the universe of the serious; he is falling into the illusion which Hegel exposed when he described the race of “intellectual animals.” There is no way for a man to escape from this world.  It is in this world that — avoiding the pitfalls we have just pointed out — he must realize himself morally.  Freedom must project itself toward its own reality through a content whose value it establishes.  An end is valid only by a return to the freedom which established it and which willed itself through this end.  But this will implies that freedom is not to be engulfed in any goal; neither is it to dissipate itself vainly without aiming at a goal.  It is not necessary for the subject to seek to be, but it must desire that there be being.  To will oneself free and to will that there be being are one and the same choice, the choice that man makes of himself as a presence in the world.  We can neither say that the free man wants freedom in order to desire being, nor that he wants the disclosure of being by freedom.  These are two aspects of a single reality.  And whichever be the one under consideration, they both imply the bond of each man with all others.  This bond does not immediately reveal itself to everybody.  A young man wills himself free.  He wills that there be being.  This spontaneous liberality which casts him ardently into the world can ally itself to what is commonly called egoism.  Often the young man perceives only that aspect of his relationship to others whereby others appear as enemies.  In the preface to The Inner Experience Georges Bataille emphasizes very forcefully that each individual wants to be All.  He sees in every other man and particularly in those whose existence is asserted with most brilliance, a limit, a condemnation of himself.  “Each consciousness,” said Hegel, “seeks the death of the other.” And indeed at every moment others are stealing the whole world away from me.  The first movement is to hate them.  But this hatred is naive, and the desire immediately struggles against itself.  If I were really everything there would be nothing beside me; the world would be empty.  There would be nothing to possess, and I myself would be nothing.  If he is reasonable, the young man immediately understands that by taking the world away from me, others also give it to me, since a thing is given to me only by the movement which snatches it from me.  To will that there be being is also to will that there be men by and for whom the world is endowed with human significations.  One can reveal the world only on a basis revealed by other men.  No project can be defined except by its interference with other projects.  To make being “be” is to communicate with others by means of being.  This truth is found in another form when we say that freedom can not will itself without aiming at an open future.  The ends which it gives itself must be unable to be transcended by any reflection, but only the freedom of other men can extend them beyond our life.  I have tried to show in Pyrrhus and Cineas that every man needs the freedom of other men and, in a sense, always wants it, even though he may be a tyrant; the only thing he fails to do is to assume honestly the consequences of such a wish.  Only the freedom of others keeps each one of us from hardening in the absurdity of facticity.  And if we are to believe the Christian myth of creation, God himself was in agreement on this point with the existentialist doctrine since, in the words of an anti-fascist priest, “He had such respect for man that He created him free.” Thus, it can be seen to what an extent those people are mistaken — or are lying — who try to make of existentialism a solipsism, like Nietzsche, would exalt the bare will to power.  According to this interpretation, as widespread as it is erroneous, the individual, knowing himself and choosing himself as the creator of his own values, would seek to impose them on others.  The result would be a conflict of opposed wills enclosed in their solitude.  But we have seen that, on the contrary, to the extent that passion, pride, and the spirit of adventure lead to this tyranny and its conflicts, existentialist ethics condems them; and it does so not in the name of an abstract law, but because, if it is true that every project emanates from subjectivity, it is also true that this subjective movement establishes by itself a surpassing of subjectivity.  Man can find a justification of his own existence only in the existence of other men.  Now, he needs such a justification; there is no escaping it.  Moral anxiety does not come to man from without; he finds within himself the anxious question, “What’s the use?” Or, to put it better, he himself is this urgent interrogation.  He flees it only by fleeing himself, and as soon as he exists he answers.  It may perhaps be said that it is for himself that he is mora’, and that such an attitude is egotistical.  But there is no ethics against which this charge, which immediately destroys itself, can not be leveled; for how can I worry about what does not concern me? I concern others and they concern me.  There we have an irreducible truth.  The me-others relationship is as indissoluble as the subject-object relationship.  At the same time the other charge which is often directed at existentialism also collapses: of being a formal doctrine, incapable of proposing any content to the freedom which it wants engaged.  To will oneself free is also to will others free.  This will is not an abstract formula.  It points out to each person concrete action to be achieved.  But the others are separate, even opposed, and the man of good will sees concrete and difficult problems arising in his relations with them.  It is this positive aspect of morality that we are now going to examine.  The Ethics of Ambiguity III 1.  THE AESTHETIC ATTITUDE Thus, every man has to do with other men.  The world in which he engages himself is a human world in which each object is penetrated with human meanings.  It is a speaking world from which solicitations and appeals rise up.  This means that, through this world, each individual can give his freedom a concrete content.  He must disclose the world with the purpose of further disclosure and by the same movement try to free men, by means of whom the world takes on meaning.  But we shall find here the same objection that we met when we examined the abstract moment of individual ethics.  If every man is free, he can not will himself free.  Likewise the objection will be raised that he can will nothing for another since that other is free in all circumstances; men are always disclosing being, in Buchenwald as well as in the blue isles of the Pacific, in hovels as well as in palaces; something is always happening in the world, and in the movement of keeping being at a distance, can one not consider its different transformations with a detached joy, or find reasons for acting? No solution is better or worse than any Other.  We may call this attitude aesthetic because the one who adopts it claims to have no other relation with the world than that of detached contemplation; outside of time and far from men, he faces history, which he thinks he does not belong to, like a pure beholding; this impersonal version equalizes all situations; it apprehends them only in the indifference of their differences; it excludes any preference.  Thus, the lover of historical works is present at the birth and the downfall of Athens, Rome, and Byzantium with the same serene passion.  The tourist considers the arena of the Coliseum, the Latifundia of Syracuse, the thermal baths, the palaces, the temples, the prisons, and the churches with the same tranquil curiosity: these things existed, that is enough to satisfy him.  Why not also consider with impartial interest those that exist today? One finds this temptation among many Italians who are weighed down by a magical and deceptive past; the present already seems to them like a future past.  Wars, civil disputes, invasions and slavery have succeeded one another in their land.  Each moment of that tormented history is contradicted by the following one; and yet in the very midst of this vain agitation there arose domes, statues, bas-reliefs, paintings and palaces which have remained intact through the centuries and which still enchant the men of today.  One can imagine an intellectual Florentine being skeptical about the great uncertain movements which are stirring up his country and which will die out as did the seethings of the centuries which have gone by: as he sees it, the important thing is merely to understand the temporary events and through them to cultivate that beauty which perishes not.  Many Frenchmen also sought relief in this thought in 1940 and the years which followed.  “Let’s try to take the point of view of history,” they said upon learning that the Germans had entered Paris.  And during the whole occupation certain intellectuals sought to keep “aloof from the fray” and to consider impartially contingent facts which did not concern them.  But we note at once that such an attitude appears in moments of discouragement and confusion; in fact, it is a position of withdrawal, a way of fleeing the truth of the present.  As concerns the past, this eclecticism is legitimate; we are no longer in a live situation in regard to Athens, Sparta, or Alexandria, and the very idea of a choice has no meaning.  But the present is not a potential past; it is the moment of choice and action; we can not avoid living it through a project; and there is no project which is purely contemplative since one always projects himself toward something, toward the future; to put oneself “outside” is still a way of living the inescapable fact that one is inside; those French intellectuals who, in the name of history, poetry, or art, sought to rise above the drama of the age, were willynilly its actors; more or less explicitly, they were playing the occupier’s game.  Likewise, the Italian aesthete, occupied in caressing the marbles and bronzes of Florence, is playing a political role in the life of his country by his very inertia.  One can not justify all that is by asserting that everything may equally be the object of contemplation, since man never contemplates: he does.  It is for the artist and the writer that the problem is raised in a particularly acute and at the same time equivocal manner, for then one seeks to set up the indifference of human situations not in the name of pure contemplation, but of a definite project: the creator projects toward the work of art a subject which he justifies insofar as it is the matter of this work; any subject may thus be admitted, a massacre as well as a masquerade.  This aesthetic justification is sometimes so striking that it betrays the author’s aim; let us say that a writer wants to communicate the horror inspired in him by children working in sweatshops; he produces so beautiful a book that, enchanted by the tale, the style, and the images, we forget the horror of the sweatshops or even start admiring it.  Will we not then be inclined to think that if death, misery, and injustice can be transfigured for our delight, it is not an evil for there to be death, misery, and injustice? But here too we must not confuse the present with the past.  With regard to the past, no further action is possible.  There have been war, plague, scandal, and treason, and there is no way of our preventing their having taken place; the executioner became an executioner and the victim underwent his fate as a victim without us; all that we can do is to reveal it, to integrate it into the human heritage, to raise it to the dignity of the aesthetic existence which bears within itself its finality; but first this history had to occur: it occurred as scandal, revolt, crime, or sacrifice, and we were able to try to save it only because it first offered us a form.  Today must also exist before being confirmed in its existence: it exists only as an engagement and a commitment.  If we first considered the world as an object to be manifested, if we thought that it was saved by this destination in such a way that everything about it already seemed justified and that there was no more of it to reject, then there would also be nothing to say about it, for no form would take shape in it; it is revealed only through rejection, desire, hate and love.  In order for the artist to have a world to express he must first be situated in this world, oppressed or oppressing, resigned or rebellious, a man among men.  But at the heart of his existence he finds the exigence which is common to all men; he must first will freedom within himself and universally; he must try to conquer it: in the light of this project situations are graded and reasons for acting are made manifest.  2.  FREEDOM AND LIBERATION One of the chief objections leveled against existentialism is that the precept “to will freedom” is only a hollow formula and offers no concrete content for action.  But that is because one has begun by emptying the word freedom of its concrete meaning; we have already seen that freedom realizes itself only by engaging itself in the world: to such an extent that man’s project toward freedom is embodied for him in definite acts of behavior.  To will freedom and to will to disclose being are one and the same choice; hence, freedom takes a positive and constructive step which causes being to pass to existence in a movement which is constantly surpassed.  Science, technics, art, and philosophy are indefinite conquests of existence over being; it is by assuming themselves as such that they take on their genuine aspect; it is in the light of this assumption that the word progress finds its veridical meaning.  It is not a matter of approaching a fixed limit: absolute Knowledge or the happiness of man or the perfection of beauty; all human effort would then be doomed to failure, for with each step forward the horizon recedes a step; for man it is a matter of pursuing the expansion of his existence and of retrieving this very effort as an absolute.  Science condemns itself to failure when, yielding to the infatuation of the serious, it aspires to attain being, to contain it, and to possess it; but it finds its truth if it considers itself as a free engagement of thought in the given, aiming, at each discovery, not at fusion with the thing, but at the possibility of new discoveries; what the mind then projects is the concrete accomplishment of its freedom.  The attempt is sometimes made to find an objective justification of science in technics; but ordinarily the mathematician is concerned with mathematics and the physicist with physics, and not with their applications.  And, furthermore, technics itself is not objectively justified; if it sets up as absolute goals the saving of time and work which it enables us to realize and the comfort and luxury which it enables us to have access to, then it appears useless and absurd, for the time that one gains can not be accumulated in a store house; it is contradictory to want to save up existence, which, the fact is, exists only by being spent, and there is a good case for showing that airplanes, machines, the telephone, and the radio do not make men of today happier than those of former times.  But actually it is not a question of giving men time and happiness, it is not a question of stopping the movement of life: it is a question of fulfilling it.  If technics is attempting to make up for this lack, which is at the very heart of existence, it fails radically; but it escapes all criticism if one admits that, through it, existence, far from wishing to repose in the security of being, thrusts itself ahead of itself in order to thrust itself still farther ahead, that it aims at an indefinite disclosure of being by the transformation of the thing into an instrument and at the opening of ever new possibilities for man.  As for art, we have already said that it should not attempt to set up idols; it should reveal existence as a reason for existing; that is really why Plato, who wanted to wrest man away from the earth and assign him to the heaven of Ideas, condemned the poets; that is why every humanism on the other hand, crowns them with laurels.  Art reveals the transitory as an absolute; and as the transitory existence is perpetuated through the centuries, art too, through the centuries, must perpetuate this never-to-be-finished revelation.  Thus, the constructive activities of man take on a valid meaning only when they are assumed as a movement toward freedom; and reciprocally, one sees that such a movement is concrete: discoveries, inventions, industries, culture, paintings, and books people the world concretely and open concrete possibilities to men.  Perhaps it is permissible to dream of a future when men will know no other use of their freedom than this free unfurling of itself; constructive activity would be possible for all; each one would be able to aim positively through his projects at his own future.  But today the fact is that there are men who can justify their life only by a negative action.  As we have already seen, every man transcends himself.  But it happens that this transcendence is condemned to fall uselessly back upon itself because it is cut off from its goals.  That is what defines a situation of oppression.  Such a situation is never natural: man is never oppressed by things; in any case, unless he is a naive child who hits stones or a mad prince who orders the sea to be thrashed, he does not rebel against things, but only against other men.  The resistance of the thing sustains the action of man as air sustains the flight of the dove; and by projecting himself through it man accepts its being an obstacle; he assumes the risk of a setback in which he does not see a denial of his freedom.  The explorer knows that he may be forced to withdraw before arriving at his goal; the scientist, that a certain phenomenon may remain obscure to him; the technician, that his attempt may prove abortive: these withdrawals and errors are another way of disclosing the world.  Certainly, a material obstacle may cruelly stand in the way of an undertaking: floods, earthquakes, grasshoppers, epidemics and plague are scourges; but here we have one of the truths of Stoicism: a man must assume even these misfortunes, and since he must never resign himself in favor of any thing, no destruction of a thing will ever be a radical ruin for him; even his death is not an evil since he is man only insofar as he is mortal: he must assume it as the natural limit of his life, as the risk implied by every step.  Only man can be an enemy for man; only he can rob him of the meaning of his acts and his life because it also belongs only to him alone to confirm it in its existence, to recognize it in actual fact as a freedom.  It is here that the Stoic distinction between “things which do not depend upon us” and those which “depend upon us” proves to be insufficient: for “we” is legion and not an individual; each one depends upon others, and what happens to me by means of others depends upon me as regards its meaning; one does not submit to a war or an occupation as he does to an earthquake: he must take sides for or against, and the foreign wills thereby become allied or hostile.  It is this interdependence which explains why oppression is possible and why it is hateful.  As we have seen, my freedom, in order to fulfill itself, requires that it emerge into an open future: it is other men who open the future to me, it is they who, setting up the world of tomorrow, define my future; but if, instead of allowing me to participate in this constructive movement, they oblige me to consume my transcendence in vain, if they keep me below the level which they have conquered and on the basis of which new conquests will be achieved, then they are cutting me off from the future, they are changing me into a thing.  Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying, and human existence is indistinguishable from an absurd vegetation; a life justifies itself only if its effort to perpetuate itself is integrated into its surpassing and if this surpassing has no other limits than those which the subject assigns himself.  Oppression divides the world into two clans: those who enlighten mankind by thrusting it ahead of itself and those who are condemned to mark time hopelessly in order merely to support the collectivity; their life is a pure repetition of mechanical gestures; their leisure is just about sufficient for them to regain their strength; the oppressor feeds himself on their transcendence and refuses to extend it by a free recognition.  The oppressed has only one solution: to deny the harmony of that mankind from which an attempt is made to exclude him, to prove that he is a man and that he is free by revolting against the tyrants.  In order to prevent this revolt, one of the ruses of oppression is to camouflage itself behind a natural situation since, after all, one can not revolt against nature.  When a conservative wishes to show that the proletariat is not oppressed, he declares that the present distribution of wealth is a natural fact and that there is thus no means of rejecting it; and doubtless he has a good case for proving that, strictly speaking, he is not stealing from the worker the product of his labor, since the word theft supposes social conventions which in other respects authorizes this type of exploitation; but what the revolutionary means by this word is that the present regime is a human fact.  As such, it has to be rejected.  This rejection cuts off the will of the oppressor, in his turn, from the future toward which he was hoping to thrust himself alone: another future is substituted, that of revolution.  The struggle is not one of words and ideologies; it is real and concrete: if it is this future which triumphs, and not the former, then it is the oppressed who is realized as a positive and open freedom and the oppressor who becomes an obstacle and a thing.  There are thus two ways of surpassing the given: it is something quite different from taking a trip or escaping from prison.  In these two cases the given is present in its surpassing; but in one case it is present insofar as it is accepted, in the other insofar as rejected, and that makes a radical difference.  Hegel has confused these two movements with the ambiguous term “aufheben”; and the whole structure of an optimism which denies failure and death rests on this ambiguity; that is what allows one to regard the future of the world as a continuous and harmonious development; this confusion is the source and also the consequence; it is a perfect epitome of that idealistic and verbose flabbiness with which Marx charged Hegel and to which he opposed a realistic toughness.  Revolt is not integrated into the harmonious development of the world; it does not wish to be integrated but rather to explode at the heart of the world and to break its continuity.  It is no accident if Marx defined the attitude of the proletariat not positively but negatively: he does not show it as affirming itself or as seeking to realize a classless society, but rather as first attempting to put an end to itself as a class.  And it is precisely because it has no other issue than a negative one that this situation must be eliminated.  All men are interested in this elimination, the oppressor as well as the oppressed, as Marx himself has said, for each one needs to have all men free.  There are cases where the slave does not know his servitude and where it is necessary to bring the seed of his liberation to him from the outside: his submission is not enough to justify the tyranny which is imposed upon him.  The slave is submissive when one has succeeded in mystifying him in such a way that his situation does not seem to him to be imposed by men, but to be immediately given by nature, by the gods, by the powers against whom revolt has no meaning; thus, he does not accept his condition through a resignation of his freedom since he can not even dream of any other; and in his relationships with his friends, for example, he can live as a free and moral man within this world where his ignorance has enclosed him.  The conservative will argue from this that this peace should not be disturbed; it is not necessary to give education to the people or comfort to the natives of the colonies; the “ringleaders” should be suppressed; that is the meaning of an old story of Maurras: there is no need to awaken the sleeper, for that would be to awaken him to unhappiness.  Certainly it is not a question of throwing men in spite of themselves, under the pretext of liberation, into a new world, one which they have not chosen, on which they have no grip.  The proponents of slavery in the Carolinas had a good case when they showed the conquerors old negro slaves who were be- wildered by a freedom which they didn’t know what to do with and who cried for their former masters; these false liberations — though in a certain sense they are inevitable — overwhelm those who are their victims as if they were a new blow of blind fate.  What must be done is to furnish the ignorant slave with the means of transcending his situation by means of revolt, to put an end to his ignorance.  We know that the problem of the nineteenth-century socialists was precisely to develop a class consciousness in the proletariat; we see in the life of Flora Tristan, for example, how thankless such a task was: what she wanted for the workers had first to be wanted without them.  “But what right does one have to want something for others?” asks the conservative, who meanwhile regards the workingman or the native as “a grown-up child” and who does not hesitate to dispose of the child’s will.  Indeed, there is nothing more arbitrary than intervening as a stranger in a destiny which is not ours: one of the shocking things about charity — in the civic sense of the word — is that it is practised from the outside, according to the caprice of the one who distributes it and who is detached from the object.  But the cause of freedom is not that of others more than it is mine: it is universally human.  If I want the slave to become conscious of his servitude, it is both in order not to be a tyrant myself — for any abstention is complicity, and complicity in this case is tyranny — and in order that new possibilities might be opened to the liberated slave and through him to all men.  To want existence, to want to disclose the world, and to want men to be free are one and the same will.  Moreover, the oppressor is lying if he claims that the oppressed positively wants oppression; he merely abstains from not wanting it because he is unaware of even the possibility of rejection.  All that an external action can propose is to put the oppressed in the presence of his freedom: then he will decide positively and freely.  The fact is that he decides against oppression, and it is then that the movement of emancipation really begins.  For if it is true that the cause of freedom is the cause of each one, it is also true that the urgency of liberation is not the same for all; Marx has rightly said that it is only to the oppressed that it appears as immediately necessary.  As for us, we do not believe in a literal necessity but in a moral exigence; the oppressed can fulfill his freedom as a man only in revolt, since the essential characteristic of the situation against which he is rebelling is precisely its prohibiting him from any positive development; it is only in social and political struggle that his transcendence passes beyond to the infinite.  And certainly the proletarrian is no more naturally a moral man than another; he can flee from his freedom, dissipate it, vegetate without desire, and give himself up to an inhuman myth; and the trick of “enlightened” capitalism is to make him forget about his concern with genuine justification, offering him, when he leaves the factory where a mechanical job absorbs his transcendence, diversions in which this transcendence ends by petering out: there you have the politics of the American employing class which catches the worker in the trap of sports, “gadgets,” autos, and frigidaires.  On the whole, however, he has fewer temptations of betrayal than the members of the privileged classes because the satisfying of his passions, the taste for adventure, and the satisfactions of social seriousness are denied him.  And in particular, it is also possible for the bourgeois and the intellectual to use their freedom positively at the same time as they can cooperate in the struggle against oppression: their future is not barred.  That is what Ponge, for example, suggests when he writes that he is producing “post-revolutionary” literature.  The writer, as well as the scientist and the technician, has the possibility of realizing, before the revolution is accomplished, this re-creation of the world which should be the task of every man if freedom were no longer enchained anywhere.  Whether or not it is desirable to anticipate the future, whether men have to give up the positive use of their freedom as long as the liberation of all has not yet been achieved, or whether, on the contrary, any human fulfillment serves the cause of man, is a point about which revolutionary politics itself is still hesitating.  Even in the Soviet Union itself the relation between the building of the future and the present struggle seems to be defined in very different ways according to the moment and the circumstances.  It is also a matter wherein each individual has to invent his solution freely.  In any case, we can assert that the oppressed is more totally engaged in the struggle than those who, though at one with him in rejecting his servitude, do not experience it; but also that, on the other hand, every man is affected by this struggle in so essential a way that he can not fulfill himself morally without taking part in it.  The problem is complicated in practice by the fact that today oppression has more than one aspect: the Arabian fellah is oppressed by both the sheiks and the French and English administration; which of the two enemies is to be combatted? The interests of the French proletariat are not the same as those of the natives in the colonies: which are to be served? But here the question is political before being moral: we must end by abolishing all suppression; each one must carry on his struggle in connection with that of the other and by integrating it into the general pattern.  What order should be followed? What tactics should be adopted? It is a matter of opportunity and efficiency.  For each one it also depends upon his individual situation.  It is possible that he may be led to sacrifice temporarily a cause whose success is subordinate to that of a cause whose defense is more urgent; on the other hand, it is possible that one may judge it necessary to maintain the tension of revolt against a situation to which one does not wish to consent at any price: thus, during the war, when Negro leaders in America were asked to drop their own claims for the sake of the general interest, Richard Wright refused; he thought that even in time of war his cause had to be defended.  In any case, morality requires that the combatant be not blinded by the goal which he sets up for himself to the point of falling into the fanaticism of seriousness or passion.  The cause which he serves must not lock itself up and thus create a new element of separation: through his own struggle he must seek to serve the universal cause of freedom.  At once the oppressor raises an objection: under the pretext of freedom, he says, there you go oppressing me in turn; you deprive me of my freedom.  It is the argument which the Southern slaveholders opposed to the abolitionists, and we know that the Yankees were so imbued with the principles of an abstract democracy that they did not grant that they had the right to deny the Southern planters the freedom to own slaves; the Civil War broke out with a completely formal pretext.  We smile at such scruples; yet today America still recognizes more or less implicitly that Southern whites have the freedom to lynch negroes.  And it is the same sophism which is innocently displayed in the newspapers of the P.  R.  L.  (Parti Republicain de la Liberte) and, more or less subtly, in all conservative organs.  When a party promises the directing classes that it will defend their freedom, it means quite plainly that it demands that they have the freedom of exploiting the working class.  A claim of this kind does not outrage us in the name of abstract justice; but a contradiction is dishonestly concealed there.  For a freedom wills itself genuinely only by willing itself as an indefinite movement through the freedom of others; as soon as it withdraws into itself, it denies itself on behalf of some object which it prefers to itself: we know well enough what sort of freedom the P.  R.  L.  demands: it is property, the feeling of possession, capital, comfort, moral security.  We have to respect freedom only when it is intended for freedom, not when it strays, flees itself, and resigns itself.  A freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied.  And it is not true that the recognition of the freedom of others limits my own freedom: to be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future; the existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom.  I am oppressed if I am thrown into prison, but not if I am kept from throwing my neighbor into prison.  Indeed, the oppressor himself is conscious of this sophism; he hardly dares to have recourse to it; rather than make an unvarnished demand for freedom to oppress he is more apt to present himself as the defender of certain values.  It is not in his own name that he is fighting, but rather in the name of civilization, of institutions, of monuments, and of virtues which realize objectively the situation which he intends to maintain; he declares that all these things are beautiful and good in themselves; he defends a past which has assumed the icy dignity of being against an uncertain future whose values have not yet been won; this is what is well expressed by the label “conservative.” As some people are curators of a museum or a collection of medals, others make themselves the curators of the given world; stressing the sacrifices that are necessarily involved in all change, they side with what has been over against what has not yet been.  It is quite certain that the surpassing of the past toward the future always demands sacrifices; to claim that in destroying an old quarter in order to build new houses on its ruins one is preserving it dialectically is a play on words; no dialectic can restore the old port of Marseilles; the past as something not surpassed, in its flesh and blood presence, has completely vanished.  All that a stubborn optimism can claim is that the past does not concern us in this particular and fixed form and that we have sacrificed nothing in sacrificing it; thus, many revolutionaries consider it healthy to refuse any attachment to the past and to profess to scorn monuments and traditions.  A left-wing journalist who was fuming impatiently in a street of Pompeii said, “What are we doing here? We’re wasting our time.” This attitude is self-confirming; let us turn away from the past, and there no longer remains any trace of it in the present, or for the future; the people of the Middle Ages had so well forgotten antiquity that there was no longer anyone who even had a desire to know something about it.  One can live without Greek, without Latin, without cathedrals, and without history.  Yes, but there are many other things that one can live without; the tendency of man is not to reduce himself but to increase his power.  To abandon the past to the night of facticity is a way of depopulating the world.  I would distrust a humanism which was too indifferent to the efforts of the men of former times; if the disclosure of being achieved by our ancestors does not at all move us, why be so interested in that which is taking place today; why wish so ardently for future realizations? To assert the reign of the human is to acknowledge man in the past as well in the future.  The Humanists of the Renaissance are an example of the help to be derived by a movement of liberation from being rooted in the past; no doubt the study of Greek and Latin does not have this living force in every age; but in any case, the fact of having a past is part of the human condition; if the world behind us were bare, we would hardly be able to see anything before us but a gloomy desert.  We must try, through our living projects, to turn to our own account that freedom which was undertaken in the past and to integrate it into the present world.  But on the other hand, we know that if the past concerns us, it does so not as a brute fact, but insofar as it has human signification; if this signification can be recognized only by a project which refuses the legacy of the past, then this legacy must be refused; it would be absurd to uphold against man a datum which is precious only insofar as the freedom of man is expressed in it.  There is one country where the cult of the past is erected into a system more than anywhere else: it is the Portugal of today; but it is at the cost of a deliberate contempt for man.  Salazar has had brand-new castles built, at great expense, on all the hills where there were ruins standing, and at Obidos he had no hesitation in appropriating for this restoration the funds that were to go to the maternity hospital, which, as a result, had to be closed; on the outskirts of Coimbre where a children’s community was to be set up, he spent so much money having the different types of old Portuguese houses reproduced on a reduced scale that barely four children could be lodged in this monstrous village.  Dances, songs, local festivals, and the wearing of old regional costumes are encouraged everywhere: they never open a school.  Here we see, in its extreme form, the absurdity of a choice which prefers the Thing to Man from whom alone the Thing can receive its value.  We may be moved by dances, songs, and regional costumes because these inventions represent the only free accomplishment which was allowed the peasants amidst the hard conditions under which they formerly lived; by means of these creations they tore themselves away from their servile work, transcended their situation, and asserted themselves as men before the beasts of burden.  Wherever these festivals still exist spontaneously, where they have retained this character, they have their meaning and their value.  But when they are ceremoniously reproduced for the edification of indifferent tourists, they are no more than a boring documentary, even an odious mystification.  It is a sophism to want to maintain by coercion things which derive their worth from the fact that men attempted through them to escape from coercion.  In like manner, all those who oppose old lace, rugs, peasant coifs, picturesque houses, regional costumes, hand-made cloth, old language, etcetera, to social evolution know very well that they are dishonest: they themselves do not much value the present reality of these things, and most of the time their lives clearly show it.  To be sure, they treat those who do not recognize the unconditional value of an Alencon point as ignoramuses; but at heart they know that these objects are less precious in themselves than as the manifestation of the civilization which they represent.  They are crying up the patience and the submission of industrious hands which were one with their needle as much as they are the lace.  We also know that the Nazis made very handsome bindings and lampshades out of human skin.  Thus, oppression can in no way justify itself in the name of the content which it is defending and which it dishonestly sets up as an idol.  Bound up with the subjectivity which established it, this content requires its own surpassing.  One does not love the past in its living truth if he insists on preserving its hardened and mummified forms.  The past is an appeal; it is an appeal toward the future which sometimes can save it only by destroying it.  Even though this destruction may be a sacrifice, it would be a lie to deny it: since man wants there to be being, he can not renounce any form of being without regret.  But a genuine ethics does not teach us either to sacrifice it or deny it: we must assume it.  The oppressor does not merely try to justify himself as a conserver.  Often he tries to invoke future realizations; he speaks in the name of the future.  Capitalism sets itself up as the regime which is most favorable to production; the colonist is the only one capable of exploiting the wealth which the native would leave fallow.  Oppression tries to defend itself by its utility.  But we have seen that it is one of the lies of the serious mind to attempt to give the word “useful” an absolute meaning; nothing is useful if it is not useful to man; nothing is useful to man if the latter is not in a position to define his own ends and values, if he is not free.  Doubtless an oppressive regime can achieve constructions which will serve man: they will serve him only from the day that he is free to use them; as long as the reign of the oppressor lasts, none of the benefits of oppression is a real benefit.  Neither in the past nor in the future can one prefer a thing to Man, who alone can establish the reason for all things.  Finally, the oppressor has a good case for showing that respect for freedom is never without difficulty, and perhaps he may even assert that one can never respect all freedoms at the same time.  But that simply means that man must accept the tension of the struggle, that his liberation must actively seek to perpetuate itself, without aiming at an impossible state of equilibrium and rest; this does not mean that he ought to prefer the sleep of slavery to this incessant conquest.  Whatever the problems raised for him, the setbacks that he will have to assume, and the difficulties with which he will have to struggle, he must reject oppression at any cost.  3.  THE ANTINOMIES OF ACTION As we have seen, if the oppressor were aware of the demands of his own freedom, he himself should have to denounce oppression.  But he is dishonest; in the name of the serious or of his passions, of his will for power or of his appetites, he refuses to give up his privileges.  In order for a liberating action to be a thoroughly moral action, it would have to be achieved through a conversion of the oppressors: there would then be a reconciliation of all freedoms.  But no one any longer dares to abandon himself today to these Utopian reveries.  We know only too well that we can not count upon a collective conversion.  However, by virtue of the fact that the oppressors refuse to co-operate in the affirmation of freedom, they embody, in the eyes of all men of good will, the absurdity of facticity; by calling for the triumph of freedom over facticity, ethics also demands that they be suppressed; and since their subjectivity, by definition, escapes our control, it will be possible to act only on their objective presence; others will here have to be treated like things, with violence; the sad fact of the separation of men will thereby be confirmed.  Thus, here is the oppressor oppressed in turn; and the men who do violence to him in their turn become masters, tyrants, and executioners: in revolting, the oppressed are metamorphosed into a blind force, a brutal fatality; the evil which divides the world is carried out in their own hearts.  And doubtless it is not a question of backing out of these consequences, for the ill-will of the oppressor imposes upon each one the alternative of being the enemy of the oppressed if he is not that of their tyrant; evidently, it is necessary to choose to sacrifice the one who is an enemy of man; but the fact is that one finds himself forced to treat certain men as things in order to win the freedom of all.  A freedom which is occupied in denying freedom is itself so outrageous that the outrageousness of the violence which one practises against it is almost cancelled out: hatred, indignation, and anger (which even the Marxist cultivates, despite the cold impartiality of the doctrine) wipe out all scruples.  But the oppressor would not be so strong if he did not have accomplices among the oppressed themselves; mystification is one of the forms of oppression; ignorance is a situation in which man may be enclosed as narrowly as in a prison; as we have already said, every individual may practise his freedom inside his world, but not everyone has the means of rejecting, even by doubt, the values, taboos, and prescriptions by which he is surrounded; doubtless, respectful minds take the object of their respect for their own; in this sense they are responsible for it, as they are responsible for their presence in the world: but they are not guilty if their adhesion is not a resignation of their freedom.  When a young sixteen-year old Nazi died crying, “Heil Hitler!” he was not guilty, and it was not he whom we hated but his masters.  The desirable thing would be to re-educate this misled youth; it would be necessary to expose the mystification and to put the men who are its victims in the presence of their freedom.  But the urgency of the struggle forbids this slow labor.  We are obliged to destroy not only the oppressor but also those who serve him, whether they do so out of ignorance or out of constraint.  As we have also seen, the situation of the world is so complex that one can not fight everywhere at the same time and for everyone.  In order to win an urgent victory, one has to give up the idea, at least temporarily, of serving certain valid causes; one may even be brought to the point of fighting against them.  Thus, during the course of the last war, no Anti-fascist could have wanted the revolts of the natives in the British Empire to be successful; on the contrary, these revolts were supported by the Fascist regimes; and yet, we can not blame those who, considering their emancipation to be the more urgent action, took advantage of the situation to obtain it.  Thus, it is possible, and often it even happens, that one finds himself obliged to oppress and kill men who are pursuing goals whose validity one acknowledges himself.  But that is not the worst thing to be said for violence.  It not only forces us to sacrifice the men who are in our way, but also those who are fighting on our side, and even ourselves.  Since we can conquer our enemies only by acting upon their facticity, by reducing them to things, we have to make ourselves things; in this struggle in which wills are forced to confront each other through their bodies, the bodies of our allies, like those of our opponents are exposed to the same brutal hazard: they will be wounded, killed, or starved.  Every war, every revolution, demands the sacrifice of a generation, of a collectivity, by those who undertake it.  And even outside of periods of crisis when blood flows, the permanent possibility of violence can constitute between nations and classes a state of veiled warfare in which individuals are sacrificed in a permanent way.  Thus one finds himself in the presence of the paradox that no action can be generated for man without its being immediately generated against men.  This obvious truth, which is universally known, is, however, so bitter that the first concern of a doctrine of action is ordinarily to mask this element of failure that is involved in any undertaking.  The parties of oppression beg the question; they deny the value of what they sacrifice in such a way that they find that they are sacrificing nothing.  Passing dishonestly from the serious to nihilism, they set up both the unconditioned value of their end and the insignificance of the men whom they are using as instruments.  High as it may be, the number of victims is always measurable; and each one taken one by one is never anything but an individual: yet, through time and space, the triumph of the cause embraces the infinite, it interests the whole collectivity.  In order to deny the outrage it is enough to deny the importance of the individual, even though it be at the cost of this collectivity: it is everything, he is only a zero.  In one sense the individual, as a matter of fact, is not very much, and we can understand the misanthrope who in 1939 declared: “After all, when you look at people one by one, it doesn’t seem so awful a thing to make war upon them.” Reduced to pure facticity, congealed in his immanence, cut off from his future, deprived of his transcendence and of the world which that transcendence discloses, a man no longer appears as anything more than a thing among things which can be subtracted from the collectivity of other things without its leaving upon the earth any trace of its absence.  Multiply this paltry existence by thousands of copies and its insignificance remains; mathematics also teaches us that zero multipled by any finite number remains zero.  It is even possible that the wretchedness of each element is only further affirmed by this futile expansion.  Horror is sometimes self-destructive before the photographs of the charnel-houses of Buchenwald and Dachau and of the ditches strewn with bones; it takes on the aspect of indifference; that decomposed, that animal flesh seems so essentially doomed to decay that one can no longer even regret that it has fulfilled its destiny; it is when a man is alive that his death appears to be an outrage, but a corpse has the stupid tranquillity of trees and stones: those who have done it say that it is easy to walk on a corpse and still easier to walk over a pile of corpses; and it is the same reason that accounts for the callousness described by those deportees who escaped death: through sickness, pain, hunger, and death, they no longer saw their comrades and themselves as anything more than an animal horde whose life or desires were no longer justified by anything, whose very revolts were only the agitations of animals.  In order to remain capable of perceiving man through these humiliated bodies one had to be sustained by political faith, intellectual pride, or Christian charity.  That is why the Nazis were so systematically relentless in casting into abjection the men they wanted to destroy: the disgust which the victims felt in regard to themselves stifled the voice of revolt and justified the executioners in their own eyes.  All oppressive regimes become stronger through the degradation of the oppressed.  In Algeria I have seen any number of colonists appease their conscience by the contempt in which they held the Arabs who were crushed with misery: the more miserable the latter were, the more contemptible they seemed, so much so that there was never any room for remorse.  And the truth is that certain tribes in the south were so ravaged by disease and famine that one could no longer feel either rebellious or hopeful regarding them; rather, one wished for the death of those unhappy creatures who have been reduced to so elemental an animality that even the maternal instict has been suppressed in them.  Yet, with all this sordid resignation, there were children who played and laughed; and their smile exposed the lie of their oppressors: it was an appeal and a promise; it projected a future before the child, a man’s future.  If, in all oppressed countries, a child’s face is so moving, it is not that the child is more moving or that he has more of a right to happiness than the others: it is that he is the living affirmation of human transcendence: he is on the watch, he is an eager hand held out to the world, he is a hope, a project.  The trick of tyrants is to enclose a man in the immanence of his facticity and to try to forget that man is always, as Heidegger puts it, “infinitely more than what he would be if he were reduced to being what he is;” man is a being of the distances, a movement toward the future, a project.  The tyrant asserts himself as a transcendence; he considers others as pure immanences: he thus arrogates to himself the right to treat them like cattle.  We see the sophism on which his conduct is based: of the ambiguous condition which is that of all men, he retains for himself the only aspect of a transcendence which is capable of justifying itself; for the others, the contingent and unjustified aspect of immanence.  But if that kind of contempt for man is convenient, it is also dangerous; the feeling of abjection can confirm men in a hopeless resignation but can not incite them to the struggle and sacrifice which is consented to with their life; this was seen in the time of the Roman decadence when men lost their zest for life and the readiness to risk it.  In any case, the tyrant himself does not openly set up this contempt as a universal principle: it is the Jew, the negro, or the native whom he encloses in his immanence; with his subordinates and his soldiers he uses different language.  For it is quite clear that if the individual is a pure zero, the sum of those zeros which make up the collectivity is also a zero: no undertaking has any importance, no defeat as well as no victory.  In order to appeal to the devotion of his troops, the chief or the authoritarian party will utilize a truth which is the opposite of the one which sanctions their brutal oppression: namely, that the value of the individual is asserted only in his surpassing.  This is one of the aspects of the doctrine of Hegel which the dictatorial regimes readily make use of.  And it is a point at which fascist ideology and Marxist ideology converge.  A doctrine which aims at the liberation of man evidently can not rest on a contempt for the individual; but it can propose to him no other salvation than his subordination to the collectivity.  The finite is nothing if it is not its transition to the infinite; the death of an individual is not a failure if it is integrated into a project which surpasses the limits of life, the substance of this life being outside of the individual himself, in the class, in the socialist State; if the individual is taught to consent to his sacrifice, the latter is abolished as such, and the soldier who has renounced himself in favor of his cause will die joyfully; in fact, that is how the young Hitlerians died.  We know how many edifying speeches this philosophy has inspired: it is by losing oneself that one finds himself, by dying that one fulfills his life, by accepting servitude that one realizes his freedom; all leaders of men preach in this vein.  And if there are any who refuse to heed this language, they are wrong, they are cowards: as such, they are worthless, they aren’t worth anyone’s bothering with them.  The brave man dies gaily, of his own free will; the one who rejects death deserves only to die.  There you have the problem elegantly resolved.  But one may ask whether this convenient solution is not self-contesting.  In Hegel the individual is only an abstract moment in the History of absolute Mind.  This is explained by the first intuition of the system which, identifying the real and the rational, empties the human world of its sensible thickness; if the truth of the here and now is only Space and Time, if the truth of one’s cause is its passage into the other, then the attachment to the individual substance of life is evidently an error, an inadequate attitude.  The essential moment of Hegelian ethics is the moment when consciousnesses recognize one another;in this operation the other is recognized as identical with me, which means that in myself it is the universal truth of my self which alone is recognized; so individuality is denied, and it can no longer reappear except on the natural and contingent plane; moral salvation will lie in my surpassing toward that other who is equal to myself and who in turn will surpass himself toward another.  Hegel himself recognizes that if this passage continued indefinitely, Totality would never be achieved, the real would peter out in the same measure: one can not, without absurdity, indefinitely sacrifice each generation to the following one; human history would then be only an endless succession of negations which would never return to the positive; all action would be destruction and life would be a vain flight.  We must admit that there will be a recovery of the real and that all sacrifices will find their positive form within the absolute Mind.  But this does not work without some difficulty.  The Mind is a subject; but who is a subject? After Descartes how can we ignore the fact that subjectivity radically signifies separation? And if it is admitted, at the cost of a contradiction, that the subject will be the men of the future reconciled, it must be clearly recognized that the men of today who turn out to have been the substance of the real, and not subjects, remain excluded forever from this reconciliation.  Furthermore, even Hegel retreats from the idea of this motionless future; since Mind is restlessness, the dialectic of struggle and conciliation can never be stopped: the future which it envisages is not the perpetual peace of Kant but an indefinite state of war.  It declares that this war will no longer appear as a temporary evil in which each individual makes a gift of himself to the State; but it is precisely at this point that there is a bit of sleight-of-hand: for why would he agree to this gift since the State can not be the achieving of the real, Totality recovering itself? The whole system seems like a huge mystification, since it subordinates all its moments to an end term whose coming it dares not set up; the individual renounces himself; but no reality in favor of which he can renounce himself is ever affirmed or recovered.  Through all this learned dialectic we finally come back to the sophism which we exposed: if the individual is nothing, society can not be something.  Take his substance away from him, and the State has no more substance; if he has nothing to sacrifice, there is nothing before him to sacrifice to.  Hegelian fullness immediately passes into the nothingness of absence.  And the very grandeur of that failure makes this truth shine forth: only the subject can justify his own existence; no external subject, no object, can bring him salvation from the outside.  He can not be regarded as a nothing, since the consciousness of all things is within him.  Thus, nihilistic pessimism and rationalistic optimism fail in their effort to juggle away the bitter truth of sacrifice: they also eliminate all reasons for wanting it.  Someone told a young invalid who wept because she had to leave her home, her occupations, and her whole past life, “Get cured.  The rest has no importance.” “But if nothing has any importance,” she answered, “what good is it to get cured?” She was right.  In order for this world to have any importance, in order for our undertaking to have a meaning and to be worthy of sacrifices, we must affirm the concrete and particular thickness of this world and the individual reality of our projects and ourselves.  This is what democratic societies understand; they strive to confirm citizens in the feeling of their individual value; the whole ceremonious apparatus of baptism, marriage, and burial is the collectivity’s homage to the individual; and the rites of justice seek to manifest society’s respect for each of its members considered in his particularity.  After or during a period of violence when men are treated like objects, one is astonished, even irritated, at seeing human life rediscover, in certain cases, a sacred character.  Why those hesitations of the courts, those long drawn-out trials, since men died by the million, like animals, since the very ones being judged coldly massacred them? The reason is that once the period of crisis, in which the democracies themselves, whether they liked it or not, had to resort to blind violence, has passed, they aim to re-establish the individual within his rights; more than ever they must restore to their members the sense of their dignity, the sense of the dignity of each man, taken one by one; the soldier must become a citizen again so that the city may continue to subsist as such, may continue to deserve one’s dedicating oneself to it.  But if the individual is set up as a unique and irreducible value, the word sacrifice regains all its meaning; what a man loses in renouncing his plans, his future, and his life no longer appears as a negligible thing.  Even if he decides that in order to justify his life he must consent to limiting its course, even if he accepts dying, there is a wrench at the heart of this acceptance, for freedom demands both that it recover itself as an absolute and that it prolong its movement indefinitely: it is through this indefinite movement that it desires to come back to itself and to confirm itself; now, death puts an end to his drive; the hero can transcend death toward a future fulfillment, but he will not be present in that future; this must be understood if one wishes to restore to heroism its true worth: it is neither natural nor easy; the hero may overcome his regret and carry out his sacrifice; the latter is none the less an absolute renunciation.  The death of those to whom we are attached by particular ties will also be consented to as an individual and irreducible misfortune.  A collectivist conception of man does not concede a valid existence to such sentiments as love, tenderness, and friendship; the abstract identity of individuals merely authorizes a comradeship between them by means of which each one is likened to each of the others.  In marching, in choral singing, in common work and struggle, all the others appear as the same; nobody ever dies.  On the contrary, if individuals recognize themselves in their differences, individual relations are established among them, and each one becomes irreplaceable for a few others.  And violence does not merely provoke in the world the wrench of the sacrifice to which one has consented; it is also undergone in revolt and refusal.  Even the one who desires a victory and who knows that it has to be paid for will wonder: why with my blood rather than with another’s? Why is it my son who is dead? And we have seen that every struggle obliges us to sacrifice people whom our victory does not concern, people who, in all honesty, reject it as a cataclysm: these people will die in astonishment, anger or despair.  Undergone as a misfortune, violence appears as a crime to the one who practices it.  That is why Saint-Just, who believed in the individual and who knew that all authority is violence, said with somber lucidity, “No one governs innocently.” We may well assume that not all those who govern have the courage to make such a confession; and furthermore it might be dangerous for them to make it too loudly.  They try to mask the crime from themselves; at least they try to conceal it from the notice of those who submit to their law.  If they can not totally deny it, they attempt to justify it.  The most radical justification would be to demonstrate that it is necessary: it then ceases to be a crime, it becomes fatality.  Even if an end is posited as necessary, the contingency of the means renders the chief’s decisions arbitrary, and each individual suffering appears as unjustified: why this bloody revolution instead of slow reforms? And who will dare to designate the victim who is anonymously demanded by the general plan? On the contrary, if only one way shows itself to be possible, if the unrolling of history is fatal, there is no longer any place for the anguish of choice, or for regret, or for outrage; revolt can no longer surge up in any heart.  This is what makes historical materialism so reassuring a doctrine; the troublesome idea of a subjective caprice or an objective chance is thereby eliminated.  The thought and the voice of the directors merely reflect the fatal exigences of History.  But in order that this faith be living and efficacious, it is necessary that no reflection mediatize the subjectivity of the chiefs and make it appear as such; if the chief considers that he does not simply reflect the given situation but that he is interpreting it, he becomes a prey to anguish: who am I to believe in myself? And if the soldier’s eyes open, he too asks: who is he to command me? Instead of a prophet, he sees nothing more than a tyrant.  That is why every authoritarian party regards thought as a danger and reflection as a crime; it is by means of thought that crime appears as such in the world.  This is one of the meanings of Koestler’s Darkness at Noon.  Roubatchov easily slips into confession because he feels that hesitation and doubt are the most radical, the most unpardonable of faults; they undermine the world of objectivity much more than does an act of capricious disobedience.  Yet, however cruel the yoke may be, in spite of the purges, murders, and deportations, every regime has opponents: there are reflection, doubt, and contestation.  And even if the opponent is in the wrong, his error brings to light a truth, namely, that there is a place in this world for error and subjectivity; whether he is right or wrong, he triumphs; he shows that the men who are in power may also be mistaken.  And furthermore, the latter know it; they know that they hesitate and that their decisions are risky.  The doctrine of necessity is much more a weapon than a faith; and if they use it, they do so because they know well enough that the soldier may act otherwise than he does, otherwise than the way they want him to, that he may disobey; they know well enough that he is free and that they are fettering his freedom.  It is the first sacrifice that they impose upon him: in order to achieve the liberation of men he has to give up his own freedom, even his freedom of thought.  In order to mask the violence, what they do is to have recourse to a new violence which even invades his mind.  Very well, replies the partisan who is sure of his aims, but this violence is useful.  And the justification which he here invokes is that which, in the most general way, inspires and legitimizes all action.  From conservatives to revolutionaries, through idealistic and moral vocabularies or realistic and positive ones, the outrageousness of violence is excused in the name of utility.  It does not much matter that the action is not fatally commanded by anterior events as long as it is called for by the proposed end; this end sets up the means which are subordinated to it; and thanks to this subordination, one can perhaps not avoid sacrifice but one can legitimize it: this is what is important to the man of action; like Saint-Just, he accepts the loss of his innocence.  It is the arbitrariness of the crime that is repugnant to him more than the crime itself.  If the sacrifices which have been assented to find their rational place within the enterprise, one escapes from the anguish of decision and from remorse.  But one has to win out; defeat would change the murders and destruction into unjustified outrage, since they would have been carried out in vain; but victory gives meaning and utility to all the misfortunes which have helped bring it about.  Such a position would be solid and satisfactory if the word useful had an absolute meaning in itself; as we have seen, the characteristic of the spirit of seriousness is precisely to confer a meaning upon it by raising the Thing or the Cause to the dignity of an unconditioned end.  The only problem then raised is a technical problem; the means will be chosen according to their effectiveness, their speed, and their economy; it is simply a question of measuring the relationships of the factors of time, cost, and probability of success.  Furthermore, in war-time discipline spares the subordinates the problems of such calculations; they concern only the staff.  The soldier does not call into question cither the aim or the means of attaining it: he obeys without any discussion.  However, what distinguishes war and politics from all other techniques is that the material that is employed is a human material.  Now human efforts and lives can no more be treated as blind instruments than human work can be treated as simple merchandise; at the same time as he is a means for attaining an end, man is himself an end.  The word useful requires a complement, and there can be only one: man himself.  And the most disciplined soldier would mutiny if skillful propaganda did not persuade him that he is dedicating himself to the cause of man: to his cause.  But is the cause of Man that of each man? That is what utilitarian ethics has been striving to demonstrate since Hegel; if one wishes to give the word useful a universal and absolute meaning, it is always a question of reabsorbing each man into the bosom of mankind; it is said that despite the weaknesses of the flesh and that particular fear which each one experiences in the face of his particular death, the real interest of each one is mingled with the general interest.  And it is true that each is bound to all; but that is precisely the ambiguity of his condition: in his surpassing toward others, each one exists absolutely as for himself; each is interested in the liberation of all, but as a separate existence engaged in his own projects.  So much so that the terms “useful to Man,” “useful to this man,” do not overlap.  Universal, absolute man exists nowhere.  From this angle, we again come upon the same antinomy: the only justification of sacrifice is its utility; but the useful is what serves Man.  Thus, in order to serve some men we must do disservice to others.  By what principle are we to choose between them? It must again be called to mind that the supreme end at which man must aim is his freedom, which alone is capable of establishing the value of every end; thus, comfort, happiness, all relative goods which human projects define, will be subordinated to this absolute condition of realization.  The freedom of a single man must count more than a cotton or rubber harvest; although this principle is not respected in fact, it is usually recognized theoretically.  But what makes the problem so difficult is that it is a matter of choosing between the negation of one freedom or another: every war supposes a discipline, every revolution a dictatorship, every political move a certain amount of lying; action implies all forms of enslaving, from murder to mystification.  Is it therefore absurd in every case? Or, in spite of everything, are we able to find, within the very outrage that it implies, reasons for wanting one thing rather than another? One generally takes numerical considerations into account by a strange compromise which clearly shows that every action treats men both as a means and as an end, as an external object and as an inwardness; it is better to save the lives of ten men than of only one.  Thus, one treats man as an end, for to set up quantity as a value is to set up the positive value of each unit; but it is setting it up as a quantifiable value, thus, as an externality.  I have known a Kantian rationalist who pas sionately maintained that it is as inmoral to choose the death of a single man as to let ten thousand die; he was right in the sense that in each murder the outrage is total; ten thousand dead — there are never ten thousand copies of a single death; no multiplication is relevant to subjectivity.  But he forgot that for the one who had the decision to make men are given, nevertheless, as objects that can be counted; it is therefore logical, though this logic implies an outrageous absurdity, to prefer the salvation of the greater number.  Moreover, this position of the problem is rather abstract, for one rarely bases a choice on pure quantity.  Those men among whom one hesitates have functions in society.  The general who is sparing of the lives of his soldiers saves them as human material that it is useful to save for tomorrow’s battles or for the reconstruction of the country; and he sometimes condemns to death thousands of civilians whose fate he is not concerned with in order to spare the lives of a hundred soldiers or ten specialists.  An extreme case is the one David Rousset describes in The Days of Our Death: the S.S.  obliged the responsible members of the concentration camps to designate which prisoners were to go to the gas chambers.  The politicians agreed to assume this responsibility because they thought that they had a valid principle of selection: they protected the politicians of their party because the lives of these men who were devoted to a cause which they thought was just seemed to them to be the most useful to preserve.  We know that the communists have been widely accused of this partiality; however, since one could in no way escape the atrocity of these massacres, the only thing to do was to try, as far as possible, to rationalize it.  It seems as if we have hardly advanced, for we come back, in the end, to the statement that what appears as useful is to sacrifice the less useful men to the more useful.  But even this shift from useful to useful will enlighten us: the complement of the word useful is the word man; but it is also the word future.  It is man insofar as he is, according to the formula of Ponge, “the future of man.” Indeed, cut off from his transcendence, reduced to the facticity of his presence, an individual is nothing; it is by his project that he fulfills himself, by the end at which he aims that he justifies himself; thus, this justification is always to come.  Only the future can take the present for its own and keep it alive by surpassing it.  A choicewill become possible in the light of the future, which is the meaning of tomorrow because the present appears as the facticity which must be transcended toward freedom.  No action is conceivable without this sovereign affirmation of the future.  But we still have to agree upon what underlies this word.  4.  THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE The word future has two meanings corresponding to the two aspects of the ambiguous condition of man which is lack of being and which is existence; it alludes to both being and existence.  When I envisage my future, I consider that movement which, prolonging my existence of today, will fulfill my present projects and will surpass them toward new ends: the future is the definite direction of a particular transcendence and it is so closely bound up with the present that it composes with it a single temporal form; this is the future which Heidegger considered as a reality which is given at each moment.  But through the centuries men have dreamed of another future in which it might be granted them to retrieve themselves as beings in Glory, Happiness, or Justice; this future did not prolong the present; it came down upon the world like a cataclysm announced by signs which cut the continuity of time: by a Messiah, by meteors, by the trumpets of the Last Judgment.  By transporting the kingdom of God to heaven, Christians have almost stripped it of its temporal character, although it was promised to the believer only at the end of his life.  It was the anti-Christian humanism of the eighteenth century which brought the myth down to earth again.  Then, through the idea of progress, an idea of the future was elaborated in which its two aspects fused: the future appeared both as the meaning of our transcendence and as the immobility of being; it is human, terrestial, and the resting-place of things.  It is in this form that it is hesitantly reflected in the systems of Hegel and of Comte.  It is in this form that it is so often invoked today as a unity of the World or as a finished socialist State.  In both cases the Future appears as both the infinite and as Totality, as number and as unity of conciliation; it is the abolition of the negative, it is fulness, happiness.  One might surmise that any sacrifice already made might be claimed in its name.  However great the quantity of men sacrificed today, the quantity that will profit by their sacrifice is infinitely greater; on the other hand, in the face of the positivity of the future, the present is only the negative which must be eliminated as such: only by dedicating itself to this positivity can the negative henceforth return to the positive.  The present is the transitory existence which is made in order to be abolished: it retrieves itself only by transcending itself toward the permanence of future being; it is only as an instrument, as a means, it is only by its efficacity with regard to the coming of the future that the present is validly realized: reduced to itself it is nothing, one may dispose of it as he pleases.  That is the ultimate meaning of the formula: the end justifies the means: all means are authorized by their very indifference.  Thus, some serenely think that the present oppression has no importance if, through it, the World can be fulfilled as such: then, within the harmonious equilibrium of work and wealth, oppression will be wiped out by itself.  Others serenely think that the present dictatorship of a party with its lies and violence has no importance if, by means of it, the socialist State is realized: arbitrariness and crime will then disappear forever from the face of the earth.  And still others think more sloppily that the shilly-shallyings and the compromises have no importance since the future will turn out well and, in some way or other, will muddle along into victory.  Those who project themselves toward a Future-Thing and submerge their freedom in it find the tranquillity of the serious.  However, we have seen that, despite the requirements of his system, even Hegel does not dare delude himself with the idea of a stationary future; he admits that, mind being restlessness, the struggle will never cease.  Marx did not consider the coming of the socialist state as an absolute result, but as the end of a pre-history on the basis of which real history begins.  However, it would be sufficient, in order for the myth of the future to be valid, for this history to be conceivable as a harmonious development where reconciled men would fulfill themselves as a pure positivity; but this dream is not permitted since man is originally a negativity.  No social upheaval, no moral conversion can eliminate this lack which is in his heart; it is by making himself a lack of being that man exists, and positive existence is this lack assumed but not eliminated; we can not establish upon existence an abstract wisdom which, turning itself away from being, would aim at only the harmony itself of the existants: for it is then the absolute silence of the in-itself which would close up around this negation of negativity; without this particular movement which thrusts him toward the future man would not exist.  But then one can not imagine any reconciliation of transcendences: they do not have the indifferent docility of a pure abstraction; they are concrete and concretely compete with others for being.  The world which they reveal is a battle-field where there is no neutral ground and which cannot be divided up into parcels: for each individual project is asserted through the world as a whole.  The fundamental ambiguity of the human condition will always open up to men the possibility of opposing choices; there will always be within them the desire to be that being of whom they have made themselves a lack, the flight from the anguish of freedom; the plane of hell, of struggle, will never be eliminated; freedom will never be given; it will always have to be won: that is what Trotsky was saying when he envisaged the future as a permanent revolution.  Thus, there is a fallacy hidden in that abuse of language which all parties make use of today to justify their politics when they declare that the world is still at war.  If one means by that that the struggle is not over, that the world is a prey to opposed interests which affront each other violently, he is speaking the truth; but he also means that such a situation is abnormal and calls for abnormal behavior; the politics that it involves can impugn every moral principle, since it has only a provisional form: later on we shall act in accordance with truth and justice.  To the idea of present war there is opposed that of a future peace when man will again find, along with a stable situation, the possibility of a morality.  But the truth is that if division and violence define war, the world has always been at war and always will be; if man is waiting for universal peace in order to establish his existence validly, he will wait indefinitely: there will never be any other future.  It is possible that some may challenge this assertion as being based upon debatable ontological presuppositions; it should at least be recognized that this harmonious future is only an uncertain dream and that in any case it is not ours.  Our hold on the future is limited; the movement of expansion of existence requires that we strive at every moment to amplify it; but where it stops our future stops too; beyond, there is nothing more because nothing more is disclosed.  From that formless night we can draw no justification of our acts, it condemns them with the same indifference; wiping out today’s errors and defeats, it will also wipe out its triumphs; it can be chaos or death as well as paradise: perhaps men will one day return to barbarism, perhaps one day the earth will no longer be anything but an icy planet.  In this perspective all moments are lost in the indistinctness of nothingness and being.  Man ought not entrust the care of his salvation to this uncertain and foreign future: it is up to him to assure it within his own existence; this existence is conceivable, as we have said, only as an affirmation of the future, but of a human future, a finite future.  It is difficult today to safeguard this sense of finiteness.  The Greek cities and the Roman republic were able to will themselves in their finiteness because the infinite which invested them was for them only darkness; they died because of this ignorance, but they also lived by it.  Today, however, we are having a hard time living because we are so bent on outwitting death.  We are aware that the whole world is interested in each of our undertakings and this spatial enlargement of our projects also governs their temporal dimension; by a paradoxical symmetry, whereas an individual accords great value to one day of his life, and a city to one year, the interests of the World are computed in centuries; the greater the human density that one envisages, the more the viewpoint of externality wins over that of internality, and the idea of externality carries with it that of quantity.  Thus, the scales of measurement have changed; space and time have expanded about us: today it is a small matter that a million men and a century seem to us only a provisional moment; yet, the individual is not touched by this transformation, his life keeps the same rhythm, his death does not retreat before him; he extends his control of the world by instruments which enable him to devour distances and to multiply the output of his effort in time; but he is always only one.  However, instead of accepting his limits, he tries to do away with them.  He aspires to act upon everything and by knowing everything.  Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries there developed the dream of a universal science which, manifesting the solidarity of the parts of the whole also admitted a universal power; it was a dream “dreamed by reason,” as Valery puts it, but which was none the less hollow, like all dreams.  For a scientist who would aspire to know everything about a phenomenon would dissolve it within the totality; and a man who would aspire to act upon the totality of the Universe would see the meaning of all action vanish.  Just as the infinity spread out before my gaze contracts above my head into a blue ceiling, so my transcendence heaps up in the distance the opaque thickness of the future; but between sky and earth there is a perceptional field with its forms and colors; and it is in the interval which separates me today from an unforeseeable future that there are meanings and ends toward which to direct my acts.  As soon as one introduces the presence of the finite individual into the world, a presence without which there is no world, finite forms stand out through time and space.  And in reverse, though a landscape is not only a transition but a particular object, an event is not only a passage but a particular reality.  If one denies with Hegel the concrete thickness of the here and now in favor of universal space-time, if one denies the separate consciousness in favor of Mind, one misses with Hegel the truth of the world.  It is no more necessary to regard History as a rational totality than to regard the Universe as such.  Man, mankind, the universe, and history are, in Sartre’s expression, “detotalized totalities,” that is, separation does not exclude relation, nor vice-versa.  Society exists only by means of the existence of particular individuals; likewise, human adventures stand out against the background of time, each finite to each, though they are all open to the infinity of the future and their individual forms thereby imply each other without destroying each other.  A conception of this kind does not contradict that of a historical unintelligibility; for it is not true that the mind has to choose between the contingent absurdity of the discontinuous and the rationalistic necessity of the continuous; on the contrary, it is part of its function to make a multiplicity of coherent ensembles stand out against the unique background of the world and, inversely, to comprehend these ensembles in the perspective of an ideal unity of the world.  Without raising the question of historical comprehension and causality it is enough to recognize the presence of intelligible sequences within temporal forms so that forecasts and consequently action may be possible.  In fact, whatever may be the philosophy we adhere to, whether our uncertainty manifests an objective and fundamental contingency or whether it expresses our subjective ignorance in the face of a rigorous necessity, the practical attitude remains the same; we must decide upon the opportuneness of an act and attempt to measure its effectiveness without knowing all the factors that are present.  Just as the scientist, in order to know a phenomenon, does not wait for the light of completed knowledge to break upon it; on the contrary, in illuminating the phenomenon, he helps establish the knowledge: in like manner, the man of action, in order to make a decision, will not wait for a perfect knowledge to prove to him the necessity of a certain choice; he must first choose and thus help fashion history.  A choice of this kind is no more arbitrary than a hypothesis; it excludes neither reflection nor even method; but it is also free, and it implies risks that must be assumed as such.  The movement of the mind, whether it be called thought or will, always starts up in the darkness.  And at bottom it matters very little, practically speaking, whether there is a Science of history or not, since this Science can come to light only at the end of the future and since at each particular moment we must, in any case, maneuver in a state of doubt.  The communists themselves admit that it is subjectively possible for them to be mistaken despite the strict dialectic of History.  The latter is not revealed to them today in its finished form; they are obliged to foresee its development, and this foresight may be erroneous.  Thus, from the political and tactical point of view there will be no difference between a doctrine of pure dialectical necessity and a doctrine which leaves room for contingency; the difference is of a moral order.  For, in the first case one admits a retrieval of each moment in the future, and thus one does not aspire to justify it by itself; in the second case, each undertaking, involving only a finite future, must be lived in its finiteness and considered as an absolute which no unknown time will ever succeed in saving.  In fact, the one who asserts the unity of history also recognizes that distinct ensembles stand out within it; and the one who emphasizes the particularity of these ensembles admits that they all project against a single horizon; just as for all there exist both individuals and a collectivity; the affirmation of the collectivity over against the individual is opposed, not on the plane of fact, but on the moral plane, to the assertion of a collectivity of individuals each existing for himself.  The case is the same in what concerns time and its moments, and just as we believe that by denying each individual one by one, one eliminates the collectivity, we think that if man gives himself up to an indefinite pursuit of the future he will lose his existence without ever recovering it; he then resembles a madman who runs after his shadow.  The means, it is said, will be justified by the end; but it is the means which define it, and if it is contradicted at the moment that it is set up, the whole enterprise sinks into absurdity.  In this way the attitude of England in regard to Spain, Greece, and Palestine is defended with the pretext that she must take up position against the Russian menace in order to save, along with her own existence, her civilization and the values of democracy; but a democracy which defends itself only by acts of oppression equivalent to those of authoritarian regimes, is precisely denying all these values; whatever the virtues of a civilization may be, it immediately belies them if it buys them by means of injustice and tyranny.  Inversely, if the justifying end is thrown ahead to the farthermost end of a mythical future, it is no longer a reflection upon the means; being nearer and clearer, the means itself becomes the goal aimed at; it blocks the horizon without, however, being deliberately wanted.  The triumph of Russia is proposed as a means of liberating the international proletariat; but has it not become an absolute end for all Stalinists? The end justifies the means only if it remains present, if it is completely disclosed in the course of the present enterprise.  And as a matter of fact, if it is true that men seek in the future a guarantee of their success, a negation of their failures, it is true that they also feel the need of denying the indefinite flight of time and of holding their present between their hands.  Existence must be asserted in the present if one does not want all life to be defined as an escape toward nothingness.  That is the reason societies institute festivals whose role is to stop the movement of transcendence, to set up the end as an end.  The hours following the liberation of Paris, for example, were an immense collective festival exalting the happy and absolute end of that particular history which was precisely the occupation of Paris.  There were at the moment worried spirits who were already surpassing the present toward future difficulties; they refused to rejoice under the pretext that new problems were going to come up immediately; but this ill-humor was met with only among those who had very slight wish to see the Germans defeated.  All those who had made this combat their combat, even if only by the sincerity of their hopes, also regarded the victory as an absolute victory, whatever the future might be.  Nobody was so naive as not to know that unhappiness would soon find other forms; but this particular unhappiness was wiped off the earth, absolutely.  That is the modern meaning of the festival, private as well as public.  Existence attempts in the festival to confirm itself positively as existence.  That is why, as Bataille has shown, it is characterized by destruction; the ethics of being is the ethics of saving: by storing up, one aims at the stationary plenitude of the in-itself, existence, on the contrary, is consumption; it makes itself only by destroying; the festival carries out this negative movement in order to indicate clearly its independence in relationship to the thing: one eats, drinks, lights fires, breaks things, and spends time and money; one spends them for nothing.  The spending is also a matter of establishing a communication of the existants, for it is by the movement of recognition which goes from one to the other that existence is confirmed; in songs, laughter, dances, eroticism, and drunkenness one seeks both an exaltation of the moment and a complicity with other men.  But the tension of existence realized as a pure negativity can not maintain itself for long; it must be immediately engaged in a new undertaking, it must dash off toward the future.  The moment of detachment, the pure affirmation of the subjective present are only abstractions; the joy becomes exhausted, drunkenness subsides into fatigue, and one finds himself with his hands empty because one can never possess the present: that is what gives festivals their pathetic and deceptive character.  One of art’s roles is to fix this passionate assertion of existence in a more durable way: the festival is at the origin of the theatre, music, the dance, and poetry.  In telling a story, in depicting it, one makes it exist in its particularity with its beginning and its end, its glory or its shame; and this is the way it actually must be lived.  In the festival, in art, men express their need to feel that they exist absolutely.  They must really fulfill this wish.  What stops them is that as soon as they give the word “end” its double meaning of goal and fulfillment they clearly perceive this ambiguity of their condition, which is the most fundamental of all: that every living movement is a sliding toward death.  But if they are willing to look it in the face they also discover that every movement toward death is life.  In the past people cried out, “The king is dead, long live the king;” thus the present must die so that it may live; existence must not deny this death which it carries in its heart; it must assert itself as an absolute in its very finiteness; man fulfills himself within the transitory or not at all.  He must regard his undertakings as finite and will them absolutely.  It is obvious that this finiteness is not that of the pure instant; we have said that the future was the meaning and the substance of all action; the limits can not be marked out a priori; there are projects which define the future of a day or of an hour; and there are others which are inserted into structures capable of being developed through one, two, or several centuries, and thereby they have a concrete hold on one or two or several centuries.  When one fights for the emancipation of oppressed natives, or the socialist revolution, he is obviously aiming at a long range goal; and he is still aiming at it concretely, beyond his own death, through the movement, the league, the institutions, or the party that he has helped set up.  What we maintain is that one must not expect that this goal be justified as a point of departure of a new future; insofar as we no longer have a hold on the time which will flow beyond its coming, we must not expect anything of that time for which we have worked; other men will have to live its joys and sorrows.  As for us, the goal must be considered as an end; we have to justify it on the basis of our freedom which has projected it, by the ensemble of the movement which ends in its fulfillment.  The tasks we have set up for ourselves and which, though exceeding the limits of our lives, are ours, must find their meaning in themselves and not in a mythical Historical end.  But then, if we reject the idea of a future-myth in order to retain only that of a living and finite future, one which delimits transitory forms, we have not removed the antinomy of action; the present sacrifices and failures no longer seem compensated for in any point of time.  And utility can no longer be defined absolutely.  Thus, are we not ending by condemning action as criminal and absurd though at the same time condemning man to action? 5.  AMBIGUITY The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity.  To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won.  Absurdity challenges every ethics; but also the finished rationalization of the real would leave no room for ethics; it is because man’s condition is ambiguous that he seeks, through failure and outrageousness, to save his existence.  Thus, to say that action has to be lived in its truth, that is, in the consciousness of the antinomies which it involves, does not mean that one has to renounce it.  In Plutarch Lied Pierrefeu rightly says that in war there is no victory which can not be regarded as unsuccessful, for the objective which one aims at is the total annihilation of the enemy and this result is never attained; yet there are wars which are won and wars which are lost.  So is it with any activity; failure and success are two aspects of reality which at the start are not perceptible.  That is what makes criticism so easy and art so difficult: the critic is always in a good position to show the limits that every artist gives himself in choosing himself; painting is not given completely either in Giotto or Titian or Cezanne; it is sought through the centuries and is never finished; a painting in which all pictorial problems are resolved is really inconceivable; painting itself is this movement toward its own reality; it is not the vain displacement of a millstone turning in the void; it concretizes itself on each canvas as an absolute existence.  Art and science do not establish themselves despite failure but through it; which does not prevent there being truths and errors, masterpieces and lemons, depending upon whether the discovery or the painting has or has not known how to win the adherence of human consciousnesses; this amounts to saying that failure, always ineluctable, is in certain cases spared and in others not.  It is interesting to pursue this comparison; not that we are likening action to a work of art or a scientific theory, but because in any case human transcendence must cope with the same problem: it has to found itself, though it is prohibited from ever fulfilling itself.  Now, we know that neither science nor art ever leaves it up to the future to justify its present existence.  In no age does art consider itself as something which is paving the way for Art: so-called archaic art prepares for classicism only in the eyes of archaeologists; the sculptor who fashioned the Korai of Athens rightfully thought that he was producing a finished work of art; in no age has science considered itself as partial and lacunary; without believing itself to be definitive, it has however, always wanted to be a total expression of the world, and it is in its totality that in each age it again raises the question of its own validity.  There we have an example of how man must, in any event, assume his finiteness: not by treating his existence as transitory or relative but by reflecting the infinite within it, that is, by treating it as absolute.  There is an art only because at every moment art has willed itself absolutely; likewise there is a liberation of man only if, in aiming at itself, freedom is achieved absolutely in the very fact of aiming at itself.  This requires that each action be considered as a finished form whose different moments, instead of fleeing toward the future in order to find there their justification, reflect and confirm one another so well that there is no longer a sharp separation between present and future, between means and ends.  But if these moments constitute a unity, there must be no contradiction among them.  Since the liberation aimed at is not a thing situated in an unfamiliar time, but a movement which realizes itself by tending to conquer, it can not attain itself if it denies itself at the start; action can not seek to fulfill itself by means which would destroy its very meaning.  So much so that in certain situations there will be no other issue for man than rejection.  In what is called political realism there is no room for rejection because the present is considered as transitory; there is rejection only if man lays claim in the present to his existence as an absolute value; then he must absolutely reject what would deny this value.  Today, more or less consciously in the name of such an ethics, we condemn a magistrate who handed over a communist to save ten hostages and along with him all the Vichyites who were trying “to make the best of things:” it was not a matter of rationalizing the present such as it was imposed by the German occupation, but of rejecting it unconditionally.  The resistance did not aspire to a positive effectiveness; it was a negation, a revolt, a martyrdom; and in this negative movement freedom was positively and absolutely confirmed.  In one sense the negative attitude is easy; the rejected object is given unequivocally and unequivocally defines the revolt that one opposes to it; thus, all French antifascists were united during the occupation by their common resistance to a single oppressor.  The return to the positive encounters many more obstacles, as we have well seen in France where divisions and hatreds were revived at the same time as were the parties.  In the moment of rejection, the antinomy of action is removed, and means and end meet; freedom immediately sets itself up as its own goal and fulfills itself by so doing.  But the antinomy reappears as soon as freedom again gives itself ends which are far off in the future; then, through the resistances of the given, divergent means offer themselves and certain ones come to be seen as contrary to their ends.  It has often been observed that revolt alone is pure.  Every construction implies the outrage of dictatorship, of violence.  This is the theme, among others, of Koestler’s Gladiators.  Those who, like this symbolic Spartacus, do not want to retreat from the outrage and resign themselves to impotence, usually seek refuge in the values of seriousness.  That is why, among individuals as well as collectivities, the negative moment is often the most genuine.  Goethe, Barres, and Aragon, disdainful or rebellious in their romantic youth, shattered old conformisms and thereby proposed a real, though incomplete, liberation.  But what happened later on? Goethe became a servant of the state, Barres of nationalism, and Aragon of Stalinist conformism.  We know how the seriousness of the Catholic Church was substituted for the Christian spirit, which was a rejection of dead Law, a subjective rapport of the individual with God through faith and charity; the Reformation was a revolt of subjectivity, but Protestantism in turn changed into an objective moralism in which the seriousness of works replaced the restlessness of faith.  As for revolutionary humanism, it accepts only rarely the tension of permanent liberation; it has created a Church where salvation is bought by membership in a party as it is bought elsewhere by baptism and indulgences.  We have seen that this recourse to the serious is a lie; it entails the sacrifice of man to the Thing, of freedom to the Cause.  In order for the return to the positive to be genuine it must involve negativity, it must not conceal the antinomies between means and end, present and future; they must be lived in a permanent tension; one must retreat from neither the outrage of violence nor deny it, or, which amounts to the same thing, assume it lightly.  Kierkegaard has said that what distinguishes the pharisee from the genuinely moral man is that the former considers his anguish as a sure sign of his virtue; from the fact that he asks himself, “Am I Abraham?” he concludes, “I am Abraham;” but morality resides in the painfulness of an indefinite questioning.  The problem which we are posing is not the same as that of Kierkegaard; the important thing to us is to know whether, in given conditions, Isaac must be killed or not.  But we also think that what distinguishes the tyrant from the man of good will is that the first rests in the certainty of his aims, whereas the second keeps asking himself, “Am I really working for the liberation of men? Isn’t this end contested by the sacrifices through which I aim at it?” In setting up its ends, freedom must put them in parentheses, confront them at each moment with that absolute end which it itself constitutes, and contest, in its own name, the means it uses to win itself.  It will be said that these considerations remain quite abstract.  What must be done, practically? Which action is good? Which is bad? To ask such a question is also to fall into a naive abstraction.  We don’t ask the physicist, “Which hypotheses are true?” Nor the artist, “By what procedures does one produce a work whose beauty is guaranteed?” Ethics does not furnish recipes any more than do science and art.  One can merely propose methods.  Thus, in science the fundamental problem is to make the idea adequate to its content and the law adequate to the facts; the logician finds that in the case where the pressure of the given fact bursts the concept which serves to comprehend it, one is obliged to invent another concept; but he can not define a priori the moment of invention, still less foresee it.  Analogously, one may say that in the case where the content of the action falsifies its meaning, one must modify not the meaning, which is here willed absolutely, but the content itself; however, it is impossible to determine this relationship between meaning and content abstractly and universally: there must be a trial and decision in each case.  But likewise just as the physicist finds it profitable to reflect on the conditions of scientific invention and the artist on those of artistic creation without expecting any ready-made solutions to come from these reflections, it is useful for the man of action to find out under what conditions his undertakings are valid.  We are going to see that on this basis new perspectives are disclosed.  In the first place, it seems to us that the individual as such is one of the ends at which our action must aim.  Here we are at one with the point of view of Christian charity, the Epicurean cult of friendship, and Kantian moralism which treats each man as an end.  He interests us not merely as a member of a class, a nation, or a collectivity, but as an individual man.  This distinguishes us from the systematic politician who cares only about collective destinies; and probably a tramp enjoying his bottle of wine, or a child playing with a balloon, or a Neapolitan lazzarone loafing in the sun in no way helps in the liberation of man; that is why the abstract will of the revolutionary scorns the concrete benevolence which occupies itself in satisfying desires which have no morrow.  However, it must not be forgotten that there is a concrete bond between freedom and existence; to will man free is to will there to be being, it is to will the disclosure of being in the joy of existence; in order for the idea of liberation to have a concrete meaning, the joy of existence must be asserted in each one, at every instant; the movement toward freedom assumes its real, flesh and blood figure in the world by thickening into pleasure, into happiness.  If the satisfaction of an old man drinking a glass of wine counts for nothing, then production and wealth are only hollow myths; they have meaning only if they are capable of being retrieved in individual and living joy.  The saving of time and the conquest of leisure have no meaning if we are not moved by the laugh of a child at play.  If we do not love life on our own account and through others, it is futile to seek to justify it in any way.  However, politics is right in rejecting benevolence to the extent that the latter thoughtlessly sacrifices the future to the present.  The ambiguity of freedom, which very often is occupied only in fleeing from itself, introduces a difficult equivocation into relationships with each individual taken one by one.  Just what is meant by the expression “to love others”? What is meant by taking them as ends? In any event, it is evident that we are not going to decide to fulfill the will of every man.  There are cases where a man positively wants evil, that is, the enslavement of other men, and he must then be fought.  It also happens that, without harming anyone, he flees from his own freedom, seeking passionately and alone to attain the being which constantly eludes him.  If he asks for our help, are we to give it to him? We blame a man who helps a drug addict intoxicate himself or a desperate man commit suicide, for we think that rash behavior of this sort is an attempt of the individual against his own freedom; he must be made aware of his error and put in the presence of the real demands of his freedom.  Well and good.  But what if he persists? Must we then use violence? There again the serious man busies himself dodging the problem; the values of life, of health, and of moral conformism being set up, one does not hesitate to impose them on others.  But we know that this pharisaism can cause the worst disasters: lacking drugs, the addict may kill himself.  It is no more necessary to serve an abstract ethics obstinately than to yield without due consideration to impulses of pity or generosity; violence is justified only if it opens concrete possibilities to the freedom which I am trying to save; by practising it I am willy-nilly assuming an engagement in relation to others and to myself; a man whom I snatch from the death which he had chosen has the right to come and ask me for means and reasons for living; the tyranny practised against an invalid can be justified only by his getting better; whatever the purity of the intention which animates me, any dictatorship is a fault for which I have to get myself pardoned.  Besides, I am in no position to make decisions of this sort indiscriminately; the example of the unknown person who throws himself in to the Seine and whom I hesitate whether or not to fish out is quite abstract; in the absence of a concrete bond with this desperate person my choice will never be anything but a contingent facticity.  If I find myself in a position to do violence to a child, or to a melancholic, sick, or distraught person the reason is that I also find myself charged with his upbringing, his happiness, and his health: I am a parent, a teacher, a nurse, a doctor, or a friend… So, by a tacit agreement, by the very fact that I am solicited, the strictness of my decision is accepted or even desired; the more seriously I accept my responsibilities, the more justified it is.  That is why love authorizes severities which are not granted to indifference.  What makes the problem so complex is that, on the one hand, one must not make himself an accomplice of that flight from freedom that is found in heedlessness, caprice, mania, and passion, and that, on the other hand, it is the abortive movement of man toward being which is his very existence, it is through the failure which he has assumed that he asserts himself as a freedom.  To want to prohibit a man from error is to forbid him to fulfill his own existence, it is to deprive him of life.  At the beginning of Claudel’s The Satin Shoe, the husband of Dona Prouheze, the Judge, the Just, as the author regards him, explains that every plant needs a gardener in order to grow and that he is the one whom heaven has destined for his young wife; beside the fact that we are shocked by the arrogance of such a thought (for how does he know that he is this enlightened gardener? Isn’t he merely a jealous husband?) this likening of a soul to a plant is not acceptable; for, as Kant would say, the value of an act lies not in its conformity to an external model, but in its internal truth.  We object to the inquisitors who want to create faith and virtue from without; we object to all forms of fascism which seek to fashion the happiness of man from without; and also the paternalism which thinks that it has done something for man by prohibiting him from certain possibilities of temptation, whereas what is necessary is to give him reasons for resisting it.  Thus, violence is not immediately justified when it opposes willful acts which one considers perverted; it becomes inadmissible if it uses the pretext of ignorance to deny a freedom which, as we have seen, can be practised within ignorance itself.  Let the “enlightened elites” strive to change the situation of the child, the illiterate, the primitive crushed beneath his superstitions; that is one of their most urgent tasks; but in this very effort they must respect a freedom which, like theirs, is absolute.  They are always opposed, for example, to the extension of universal suffrage by adducing the incompetence of the masses, of women, of the natives in the colonies; but this forgetting that man always has to decide by himself in the darkness, that he must want beyond what he knows.  If infinite knowledge were necessary (even supposing that it were conceivable), then the colonial administrator himself would not have the right to freedom; he is much further from perfect knowledge than the most backward savage is from him.  Actually, to vote is not to govern; and to govern is not merely to maneuver; there is an ambiguity today, and particularly in France, because we think that we are not the master of our destiny; we no longer hope to help make history, we are resigned to submitting to it; all that our internal politics does is reflect the play of external forces, no party hopes to determine the fate of the country but merely to foresee the future which is being prepared in the world by foreign powers and to use, as best we can, the bit of indetermination which still escapes their foresight.  Drawn along by this tactical realism, the citizens themselves no longer consider the vote as the assertion of their will but as a maneuver, whether one adheres completely to the maneuvering of a party or whether.  one invents his own strategy; the electors consider themselves not as men who are consulted about a particular point but as forces which are numbered and which are ordered about with a view to distant ends.  And that is probably why the French, who formerly were so eager to declare their opinions, take no further interest in an act which has become a disheartening strategy.  So, the fact is that if it is necessary not to vote but to measure the weight of one’s vote, this calculation requires such extensive information and such a sureness of foresight that only a specialized technician can have the boldness to express an opinion.  But that is one of the abuses whereby the whole meaning of democracy is lost; the logical conclusion of this would be to suppress the vote.  The vote should really be the expression of a concrete will, the choice of a representative capable of defending, within the general framework of the country and the world, the particular interests of his electors.  The ignorant and the outcast also has interests to defend; he alone is “competent” to decide upon his hopes and his trust.  By a sophism which leans upon the dishonesty of the serious, one does not merely argue about his formal impotence to choose, but one draws arguments from the content of his choice.  I recall, among others, the naivete of a rightthinking young girl who said, “The vote for women is all well and good in principle, only, if women get the vote, they’ll all vote red.” With like impudence it is almost unanimously stated today in France that if the natives of the French Union were given the rights of self-determination, they would live quietly in their villages without doing anything, which would be harmful to the higher interests of the Economy.  And doubtless the state of stagnation in which they choose to live is not that which a man can wish for another man; it is desirable to open new possibilities to the indolent negroes so that the interests of the Economy may one day merge with theirs.  But for the time being, they are left to vegetate in the sort of situation where their freedom can merely be negative: the best thing they can desire is not to tire themselves, not to suffer, and not to work; and even this freedom is denied them.  It is the most consummate and inacceptable form of oppression.  However, the “enlightened elite” objects, one does not let a child dispose of himself, one does not permit him to vote.  This is another sophism.  To the extent that woman or the happy or resigned slave lives in the infantile world of ready-made values, calling them “an eternal child” or “a grown-up child” has some meaning, but the analogy is only partial.  Childhood is a particular sort of situation: it is a natural situation whose limits are not created by other men and which is thereby not comparable to a situation of oppression; it is a situation which is common to all men and which is temporary for all; therefore, it does not represent a limit which cuts off the individual from his possibilities, but, on the contrary, the moment of a development in which new possibilities are won.  The child is ignorant because he has not yet had the time to acquire knowledge, not because this time has been refused him.  To treat him as a child is not to bar him from the future but to open it to him; he needs to be taken in hand, he invites authority, it is the form which the resistance of facticity, through which all liberation is brought about, takes for him.  And on the other hand, even in this situation the child has a right to his freedom and must be respected as a human person.  What gives Emile its value is the brilliance with which Rousseau asserts this principle.  There is a very annoying naturalistic optimism in Emile; in the rearing of the child, as in any relationship with others, the ambiguity of freedom implies the outrage of violence; in a sense, all education is a failure.  But Rousseau is right in refusing to allow childhood to be oppressed.  And in practice raising a child as one cultivates a plant which one does not consult about its needs is very different from considering it as a freedom to whom the future must be opened.  Thus, we can set up point number one: the good of an individual or a group of individuals requires that it be taken as an absolute end of our action; but we are not authorized to decide upon this end a priori.  The fact is that no behavior is ever authorized to begin with, and one of the concrete consequences of existentialist ethics is the rejection of all the previous justifications which might be drawn from the civilization, the age, and the culture; it is the rejection of every principle of authority.  To put it positively, the precept will be to treat the other (to the extent that he is the only one concerned, which is the moment that we are considering at present) as a freedom so that his end may be freedom; in using this conductingwire one will have to incur the risk, in each case, of inventing an original solution.  Out of disappointment in love a young girl takes an overdose of pheno-barbital; in the morning friends find her dying, they call a doctor, she is saved; later on she becomes a happy mother of a family; her friends were right in considering her suicide as a hasty and heedless act and in putting her into a position to reject it or return to it freely.  But in asylums one sees melancholic patients who have tried to commit suicide twenty times, who devote their freedom to seeking the means of escaping their jailers and of putting an end to their intolerable anguish; the doctor who gives them a friendly pat on the shoulder is their tyrant and their torturer.  A friend who is intoxicated by alcohol or drugs asks me for money so that he can go and buy the poison that is necessary to him; I urge him to get cured, I take him to a doctor, I try to help him live; insofar as there is a chance of my being successful, I am acting correctly in refusing him the sum he asks for.  But if circumstances prohibit me from doing anything to change the situation in which he is struggling, all I can do is give in; a deprivation of a few hours will do nothing but exasperate his torments uselessly; and he may have recourse to extreme means to get what I do not give him.  That is also the problem touched on by Ibsen in The Wild Duck.  An individual lives in a situation of falsehood; the falsehood is violence, tyranny: shall I tell the truth in order to free the victim? It would first be necessary to create a situation of such a kind that the truth might be bearable and that, though losing his illusions, the deluded individual might again find about him reasons for hoping.  What makes the problem more complex is that the freedom of one man almost always concerns that of other individuals.  Here is a married couple who persist in living in a hovel; if one does not succeed in giving them the desire to live in a more healthful dwelling, they must be allowed to follow their preferences; but the situation changes if they have children; the freedom of the parents would be the ruin of their sons, and as freedom and the future are on the side of the latter, these are the ones who must first be taken into account.  The Other is multiple, and on the basis of this new questions arise.  One might first wonder for whom we are seeking freedom and happiness.  When raised in this way, the problem is abstract; the answer will, therefore, be arbitrary, and the arbitrary always involves outrage.  It is not entirely the fault of the district social-worker if she is apt to be odious; because, her money and time being limited, she hesitates before distributing it to this one or that one, she appears to others as a pure externality, a blind facticity.  Contrary to the formal strictness of Kantianism for whom the more abstract the act is the more virtuous it is, generosity seems to us to be better grounded and therefore more valid the less distinction there is between the other and ourself and the more we fulfill ourself in taking the other as an end.  That is what happens if I am engaged in relation to others.  The Stoics impugned the ties of family, friendship, and nationality so that they recognized only the universal form of man.  But man is man only through situations whose particularity is precisely a universal fact.  There are men who expect help from certain men and not from others, and these expectations define privileged lines of action.  It is fitting that the negro fight for the negro, the Jew for the Jew, the proletarian for the proletarian, and the Spaniard in Spain.  But the assertion of these particular solidarities must not contradict the will for universal solidarity and each finite undertaking must also be open on the totality of men.  But it is then that we find in concrete form the conflicts which we have described abstractly; for the cause of freedom can triumph only through particular sacrifices.  And certainly there are hierarchies among the goods desired by men: one will not hesitate to sacrifice the comfort, luxury, and leisure of certain men to assure the liberation of certain others; but when it is a question of choosing among freedoms, how shall we decide? Let us repeat, one can only indicate a method here.  The first point is always to consider what genuine human interest fills the abstract form which one proposes as the action’s end.  Politics always puts forward Ideas: Nation, Empire, Union, Economy, etc.  But none of these forms has value in itself; it has it only insofar as it involves concrete individuals.  If a nation can assert itself proudly only to the detriment of its members, if a union can be created only to the detriment of those it is trying to unite, the nation or the union must be rejected.  We repudiate all idealisms, mysticisms, etcetera which prefer a Form to man himself.  But the matter becomes really agonizing when it is a question of a Cause which genuinely serves man.  That is why the question of Stalinist politics, the problem of the relationship of the Party to the masses which it uses in order to serve them, is in the forefront of the preoccupations of all men of good will.  However, there are very few who raise it without dishonesty, and we must first try to dispel a few fallacies.  The opponent of the U.S.S.R.  is making use of a fallacy when, emphasizing the part of criminal violence assumed by Stalinist politics, he neglects to confront it with the ends pursued.  Doubtless, the purges, the deportations, the abuses of the occupation, and the police dictatorship surpass in importance the violences practised by any other country; the very fact that there are a hundred and sixty million inhabitants in Russia multiplies the numerical coefficient of the injustices committed.  But these quantitative considerations are insufficient.  One can no more judge the means without the end which gives it its meaning than he can detach the end from the means which defines it.  Lynching a negro or suppressing a hundred members of the opposition are two analogous acts.  Lynching is an absolute evil; it represents the survival of an obsolete civilization, the perpetuation of a struggle of races which has to disappear; it is a fault without justification or excuse.  Suppressing a hundred opponents is surely an outrage, but it may have meaning and a reason; it is a matter of maintaining a regime which brings to an immense mass of men a bettering of their lot.  Perhaps this measure could have been avoided; perhaps it merely represents that necessary element of failure which is involved in any positive construction.  It can be judged only by being replaced in the ensemble of the cause it serves.  But, on the other hand, the defender of the U.S.S.R.  is making use of a fallacy when he unconditionally justifies the sacrifices and the crimes by the ends pursued; it would first be necessary to prove that, on the one hand, the end is unconditioned and that, on the other hand, the crimes committed in its name were strictly necessary.  Against the death of Bukharin one counters with Stalingrad; but one would have to know to what effective extent the Moscow trials increased the chances of the Russian victory.  One of the ruses of Stalinist orthodoxy is, playing on the idea of necessity, to put the whole of the revolution on one side of the scale; the other side will always seem very light.  But the very idea of a total dialectic of history does not imply that any factor is ever determining; on the contrary, if one admits that the life of a man may change the course of events, it is that one adheres to the conception which grants a preponderant role to Cleopatra’s nose and Cromwell’s wart.  One is here playing, with utter dishonesty, on two opposite conceptions of the idea of necessity: one synthetic, and the other analytic; one dialectic, the other deterministic.  The first makes History appear as an intelligible becoming within which the particularity of contingent accidents is reabsorbed; the dialectical sequence of the moments is possible only if there is within each moment an indetermination of the particular elements taken one by one.  If, on the contrary, one grants the strict determinism of each causal series, one ends in a contingent and disordered vision of the ensemble, the conjunction of the series being brought about by chance.  Therefore, a Marxist must recognize that none of his particular decisions involves the revolution in its totality; it is merely a matter of hastening or retarding its coming, of saving himself the use of other and more costly means.  That does not mean that he must retreat from violence but that he must not regard it as justified a priori by its ends.  If he considers his enterprise in its truth, that is, in its finiteness, he will understand that he has never anything but a finite stake to oppose to the sacrifices which he calls for, and that it is an uncertain stake.  Of course, this uncertainty should not keep him from pursuing his goals; but it requires that one concern himself in each case with finding a balance between the goal and its means.  Thus, we challenge every condemnation as well as every a prion justification of the violence practised with a view to a valid end.  They must be legitimized concretely.  A calm, mathematical calculation is here impossible.  One must attempt to judge the chances of success that are involved in a certain sacrifice; but at the beginning this judgment will always be doubtful; besides, in the face of the immediate reality of the sacrifice, the notion of chance is difficult to think about.  On the one hand, one can multiply a probability infinitely without ever reaching certainty; but yet, practically, it ends by merging with this asymptote: in our private life as in our collective life there is no other truth than a statistical one.  On the other hand, the interests at stake do not allow themselves to be put into an equation; the suffering of one man, that of a million men, are incommensurable with the conquests realized by millions of others, present death is incommensurable with the life to come.  It would be Utopian to want to set up on the one hand the chances of success multiplied by the stake one is after, and on the other hand the weight of the immediate sacrifice.  One finds himself back at the anguish of free decision.  And that is why political choice is an ethical choice: it is a wager as well as a decision; one bets on the chances and risks of the measure under consideration; but whether chances and risks must be assumed or not in the given circumstances must be decided without help, and in so doing one sets up values.  If in 1793 the Girondists rejected the violences of the Terror whereas a Saint-Just and a Robespierre assumed them, the reason is that they did not have the same conception of freedom.  Nor was the same republic being aimed at between 1830 and 1840 by the republicans who limited themselves to a purely political opposition and those who adopted the technique of insurrection.  In each case it is a matter of defining an end and realizing it, knowing that the choice of the means employed affects both the definition and the fulfillment.  Ordinarily, situations are so complex that a long analysis is necessary before being able to pose the ethical moment of the choice.  We shall confine ourselves here to the consideration of a few simple examples which will enable us to make our attitude somewhat more precise.  In an underground revolutionary movement when one discovers the presence of a stool-pigeon, one does not hesitate to beat him up; he is a present and future danger who has to be gotten rid of; but if a man is merely suspected of treason, the case is more ambiguous.  We blame those northern peasants who in the war of 1914-18 massacred an innocent family which was suspected of signaling to the enemy; the reason is that not only were the presumptions vague, but the danger was uncertain; at any rate, it was enough to put the suspects into prison; while waiting for a serious inquiry it was easy to keep them from doing any harm.  However, if a questionable individual holds the fate of other men in his hands, if, in order to avoid the risk of killing one innocent man, one runs the risk of letting ten innocent men die, it is reasonable to sacrifice him.  We can merely ask that such decisions be not taken hastily and lightly, and that, all things considered, the evil that one inflicts be lesser than that which is being forestalled.  There are cases still more disturbing because there the violence is not immediately efficacious; the violences of the Resistance did not aim at the material weakening of Germany; it happens that their purpose was to create such a state of violence that collaboration would be impossible; in one sense, the burning of a whole French village was too high a price to pay for the elimination of three enemy officers; but those fires and the massacring of hostages were themselves parts of the plan; they created an abyss between the occupiers and the occupied.  Likewise, the insurrections in Paris and Lyons at the beginning of the nineteenth century, or the revolts in India, did not aim at shattering the yoke of the oppressor at one blow, but rather at creating and keeping alive the meaning of the revolt and at making the mystifications of conciliation impossible.  Attempts which are aware that one by one they are doomed to failure can be legitimized by the whole of the situation which they create.  This is also the meaning of Steinbeck’s novel In Dubious Battle where a communist leader does not hesitate to launch a costly strike of uncertain success but through which there will be born, along with the solidarity of the workers, the consciousness of exploitation and the will to reject it.  It seems to me interesting to contrast this example with the debate in John Dos Passos’ The Adventures of a Young Man.  Following a strike, some American miners are condemned to death.  Their comrades try to have their trial reconsidered.  Two methods are put forward: one can act officially, and one knows that they then have an excellent chance of winning their case; one can also work up a sensational trial with the Communist Party taking the affair in hand, stirring up a press campaign and circulating international petitions; but the court will be unwilling to yield to this intimidation.  The party will thereby get a tremendous amount of publicity, but the miners will be condemned.  What is a man of good will to decide in this case? Dos Passos’ hero chooses to save the miners and we believe that he did right.  Certainly, if it were necessary to choose between the whole revolution and the lives of two or three men, no revolutionary would hesitate; but it was merely a matter of helping along the party propaganda, or better, of increasing somewhat its chances of developing within the United States; the immediate interest of the C.P.  in that country is only hypothetically tied up with that of the revolution; in fact, a cataclysm like the war has so upset the situation of the world that a great part of the gains and losses of the past have been absolutely swept away.  If it is really men which the movement claims to be serving, in this case it must prefer saving the lives of three concrete individuals to a very uncertain and weak chance of serving a little more effectively by their sacrifice the mankind to come.  If it considers these lives negligible, it is because it too ranges itself on the side of the formal politicians who prefer the Idea to its content; it is because it prefers itself, in its subjectivity, to the goals to which it claims to be dedicated.  Besides, whereas in the example chosen by Steinbeck the strike is immediately an appeal to the freedom of the workers and in its very failure is already a liberation, the sacrifice of the miners is a mystification and an oppression; they are duped by being made to believe that an effort is being made to save their lives, and the whole proletariat is duped with them.  Thus, in both examples, we find ourselves before the same abstract case: men are going to die so that the party which claims to be serving them will realize a limited gain; but a concrete analysis leads us to opposite moral solutions.  It is apparent that the method we are proposing, analogous in this respect to scientific or aesthetic methods, consists, in each case, of confronting the values realized with the values aimed at, and the meaning of the act with its content.  The fact is that the politician, contrary to the scientist and the artist, and although the element of failure which he assumes is much more outrageous, is rarely concerned with making use of it.  May it be that there is an irresistible dialectic of power wherein morality has no place? Is the ethical concern, even in its realistic and concrete form, detrimental to the interests of action? The objection will surely be made that hesitation and misgivings only impede victory.  Since, in any case, there is an element of failure in all success, since the ambiguity, at any rate, must be surmounted, why not refuse to take notice of it? In the first number of the Cahiers d’Action a reader declared that once and for all we should regard the militant communist as “the permanent hero of our time” and should reject the exhausting tension demanded by existentialism; installed in the permanence of heroism, one will blindly direct himself toward an uncontested goal; but one then resembles Colonel de la Roque who unwaveringly went right straight ahead of him without knowing where he was going.  Malaparte relates that the young Nazis, in order to become insensitive to the suffering of others, practised by plucking out the eyes of live cats; there is no more radical way of avoiding the pitfalls of ambiguity.  But an action which wants to serve man ought to be careful not to forget him on the way; if it chooses to fulfill itself blindly, it will lose its meaning or will take on an unforeseen meaning; for the goal is not fixed once and for all; it is defined all along the road which leads to it.  Vigilance alone can keep alive the validity of the goals and the genuine assertion of freedom.  Moreover, ambiguity can not fail to appear on the scene; it is felt by the victim, and his revolt or his complaints also make it exist for his tyrant; the latter will then be tempted to put everything into question, to renounce, thus denying both himself and his ends; or, if he persists, he will continue to blind himself only by multiplying crimes and by perverting his original design more and more.  The fact is that the man of action becomes a dictator not in respect to his ends but because these ends are necessarily set up through his will.  Hegel, in his Phenomenology, has emphasized this inextricable confusion between objectivity and subjectivity.  A man gives himself to a Cause only by making it his Cause; as he fulfills himself within it, it is also through him that it is expressed, and the will to power is not distinguished in such a case from generosity; when an individual or a party chooses to triumph, whatever the cost may be, it is their own triumph which they take for an end.  If the fusion of the Commissar and the Yogi were realized, there would be a self-criticism in the man of action which would expose to him the ambiguity of his will, thus arresting the imperious drive of his subjectivity and, by the same token, contesting the unconditioned value of the goal.  But the fact is that the politician follows the line of least resistance; it is easy to fall asleep over the unhappiness of others and to count it for very little; it is easier to throw a hundred men, ninety-seven of whom are innocent, into prison, than to discover the three culprits who are hidden among them; it is easier to kill a man than to keep a close watch on him; all politics makes use of the police, which officially flaunts its radical contempt for the individual and which loves violence for its own sake.  The thing that goes by the name of political necessity is in part the laziness and brutality of the police.  That is why it is incumbent upon ethics not to follow the line of least resistance; an act which is not destined, but rather quite freely consented to; it must make itself effective so that what was at first facility may become difficult.  For want of internal criticism, this is the role that an opposition must take upon itself.  There are two types of opposition.  The first is a rejection of the very ends set up by a regime: it is the opposition of anti-fascism to fascism, of fascism to socialism.  In the second type, the oppositionist accepts the objective goal but criticizes the subjective movement which aims at it; he may not even wish for a change of power, but he deems it necessary to bring into play a contestation which will make the subjective appear as such.  Thereby he exacts a perpetual contestation of the means by the end and of the end by the means.  He must be careful himself not to ruin, by the means which he employs, the end he is aiming at, and above all not to pass into the service of the oppositionists of the first type.  But, delicate as it may be, his role is, neverthless, necessary.  Indeed, on the one hand, it would be absurd to oppose a liberating action with the pretext that it implies crime and tyranny; for without crime and tyranny there could be no liberation of man; one can not escape that dialectic which goes from freedom to freedom through dictatorship and oppression.  But, on the other hand, he would be guilty of allowing the liberating movement to harden into a moment which is acceptable only if it passes into its opposite; tyranny and crime must be kept from triumphantly establishing themselves in the world; the conquest of freedom is their only justification, and the assertion of freedom against them must therefore be kept alive.
